- Always take into consideration your alternatives. In software development, you need to be open-minded and never trust one solution as being **"the one"**. You'll always find scenarios in which a specific technology works better than the other.

- When implementing an application, always think of all possibilities, including not using a framework. If you decide to use one or more frameworks, take into consideration all their alternatives. You should think about the purpose of the framework, who else is using it (how big is the community), and for how long it's been on the market (maturity).

- **At the end of the day, what we're all here for?** Not for the tweets, not for the stars, not for the downloads. We're here to build cool stuff with tools that we like to use. We're here for the glory of shipping stuff that we're proud to say we built.
