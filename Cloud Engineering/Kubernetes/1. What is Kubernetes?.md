Kubernetes is an open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services. It makes it easy to orchestrate many containers on many hosts, scale them as microservices, and easily deploy rollouts and rollbacks.

At the highest level, Kubernetes is a set of APIs that you can use to deploy containers on a set of nodes called a cluster.

The system is divided into a set of primary components that run as the control plane and a set of nodes that run containers.

> **NOTE:** In Kubernetes, a node represents a computing instance, like a machine.

**In short, you describe a set of applications and how they should interact with each other, and Kubernetes determines how to make that happen.**

Kubernetes supports declarative configurations. When you administer your infrastructure declaratively, you describe the desired state you want to achieve, instead of issuing a series of commands to achieve that desired state. Kubernetesâ€™s job is to make the deployed system conform to your desired state and to keep it there in spite of failures.

Kubernetes can automatically scale containerized applications in and out based on resource utilization.
