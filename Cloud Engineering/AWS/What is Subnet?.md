A **subnet** (short for subnetwork) is a smaller, logical subdivision of a larger network.

In the context of **cloud (like AWS VPCs)** or traditional networking:

- A **network** is identified by an **IP address range** (for example, `10.0.0.0/16`).
- That large block of IP addresses can be split into **subnets**, each with its own smaller range (for example, `10.0.1.0/24` or `10.0.2.0/24`).
