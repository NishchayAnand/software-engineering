1. Use `fixed`, `top-0`, `left-0`, `z-100` to make sure the navigation bar always stay fixed at the top-left and all other elements scroll below it.

2. Give a fixed height, e.g., `h-[4rem]` to the navbar.

3. Use `flex` to create a row that spans the entire width of the screen.

4. Use `items-center` to keep all elements in the navigation bar vertically centered.

5. Use `justify-between` to put the first element at the start of the navigation, last element to the end of the navigation bar and all other elements spread evenly between the first and last elements.
