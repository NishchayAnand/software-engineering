Client-side transitions are what makes a server-rendered apps _feel_ like client-rendered apps. And when paired with [prefetching](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/linking-and-navigating#prefetching) and [streaming](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/linking-and-navigating#streaming), it enables fast transitions, even for dynamic routes.

### What can make transitions slow?

These Next.js optimizations make navigation fast and responsive. However, under certain conditions, transitions can still _feel_ slow. Here are some common causes and how to improve the user experience:

**Dynamic routes without `loading.tsx`**

When navigating to a dynamic route, the client must wait for the server response before showing the result. This can give the users the impression that the app is not responding.

We recommend adding `loading.tsx` to dynamic routes to enable partial prefetching, trigger immediate navigation, and display a loading UI while the route renders.

```
export default function Loading() {
  return <LoadingSkeleton />
}
```
