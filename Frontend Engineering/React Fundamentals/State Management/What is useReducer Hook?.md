The `useReducer` Hook is similar to `useState`—you must pass it an initial state and it returns a stateful value and a way to set state (in this case, the dispatch function). But it’s a little different.

The `useReducer` Hook takes two arguments:

1. A reducer function
2. An initial state

And it returns:

1. A stateful value
2. A dispatch function (to “dispatch” user actions to the reducer)

### Comparing `useState` and `useReducer`

Reducers are not without downsides! Here’s a few ways you can compare them:

- **Code size:** Generally, with `useState` you have to write less code upfront. With `useReducer`, you have to write both a reducer function _and_ dispatch actions. However, `useReducer` <span style="color:red;">can help cut down on the code if many event handlers modify state in a similar way</span>.

- **Readability:** `useState` is very easy to read when the state updates are simple. When they get more complex, they can bloat your component’s code and make it difficult to scan. In this case, `useReducer` lets you cleanly separate the _how_ of update logic from the _what happened_ of event handlers.

- **Debugging:** When you have a bug with `useState`, it can be difficult to tell _where_ the state was set incorrectly, and _why_. With `useReducer`, you can add a console log into your reducer to see every state update, and _why_ it happened (due to which `action`). If each `action` is correct, you’ll know that the mistake is in the reducer logic itself. However, you have to step through more code than with `useState`.

- **Testing:** A reducer is a pure function that doesn’t depend on your component. This means that you can export and test it separately in isolation. While generally it’s best to test components in a more realistic environment, for complex state update logic it can be useful to assert that your reducer returns a particular state for a particular initial state and action.

- **Personal preference:** <span style="color:red;">Some people like reducers, others don’t. That’s okay. It’s a matter of preference. You can always convert between</span> `useState` <span style="color:red;">and</span> `useReducer` <span style="color:red;">back and forth: they are equivalent!</span>

> **NOTE:** We recommend using a reducer if you often encounter bugs due to incorrect state updates in some component, and want to introduce more structure to its code. You don’t have to use reducers for everything: feel free to mix and match! You can even `useState` and `useReducer` in the same component.
