talk about whether to use micro-frontends or not.

whether to use state management library like Redux or not.

Pagination prevents single requests from returning huge payloads that spike CPU, memory, network and downstream services (ES, DB).

Use server-side fetch in the Home page (preferred) and pass the list into the client `SearchHotelForm` as a prop. This prefetches from hotel-service -> hotelDB when the page renders and avoids extra client fetch.

Make Home a server component that fetches locations from your hotel-service and maps them to the shape the form expects (label/value).
