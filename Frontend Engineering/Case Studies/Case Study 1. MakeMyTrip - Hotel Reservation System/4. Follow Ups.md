Using Form Component from Shadcn allowed us to leverage react-hook-form to implicitly manage all search parameters for hotel search form. The react-hook-form will handle the state management of all input parameters, collate them as a single object and pass it to the form submit handler.

When the user searches hotels, we want the frontend to navigate to the SearchPage, display a loading state while the frontend gets list of available hotels and then finally update the SearchPage to display all the fetched hotels.
