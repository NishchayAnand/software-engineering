Form Component from Shadcn allows us to leverage react-hook-form to implicitly manage all search parameters for hotel search form. The react-hook-form will handle the state management of all input parameters, collate them as a single object and pass it to the form submit handler.

When the user searches hotels, the frontend should navigate to the SearchPage, send a request to the Inventory Service to fetch list of available hotels and display them as list of Shadcn cards.
