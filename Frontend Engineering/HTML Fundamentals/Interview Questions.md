# HTML Interview Questions

**Q. When to use `<section>` tag?**

The `<section>` tag in HTML is used to define a semantic sectioning element. It doesn't have a specific visual rendering by default. The primary purpose of `<section>` is to group related content together logically.

Some common use cases for the `<section>` tag include:

1. **Main sections of a webpage:** Header, main content area, sidebar, footer, etc.
2. **Logical groupings within content:** Dedicated sections for articles, blog posts, product descriptions, customer reviews, etc.

Browsers and React enforce **HTML semantics**. A `<p>` element **cannot contain** block elements like `<div>` (and some other elements).
