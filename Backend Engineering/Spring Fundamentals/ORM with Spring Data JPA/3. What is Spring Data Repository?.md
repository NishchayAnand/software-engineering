The goal of spring data repository abstraction is to significantly reduce the amount of boilerplate code required to implement data access layers for various persistence stores.

By simply declaring an interface like `public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {}`, Spring Data JPA creates a proxy instance and provides built-in implementations for standard CRUD operations and query methods based on method names.

<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">Extending</span> `JpaRepository` <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">(an interface) lets Spring Data generate the implementation for you at runtime.</span> If you implemented the repository yourself you'd have to write all CRUD/query code, wiring and transaction handling. Extending gives you:

- Automatic CRUD methods (save, findById, delete, etc.)
- Derived query methods (findBy..., findAllBy...)
- Paging/sorting support
- Integration with Spring transactions and exception translation
- Much less boilerplate and fewer bugs
