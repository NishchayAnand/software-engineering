Spring Data JPA is a module of the Spring Data project, built on top of JPA and Hibernate (or any other JPA implementation), making it easier to develop robust and database-independent data access logic in Spring applications.

Spring Data JPA simplifies the use of the Java Persistence API (JPA) within Spring-based applications.Â While not an ORM itself, it provides a powerful abstraction layer over JPA providers like Hibernate, significantly reducing boilerplate code for data access operations.

### Key Points

1. Provides repository interfaces like `JpaRepository` and `CrudRepository` that include pre-defined methods for common database operations (e.g., save, delete, find, etc.), eliminating the need for boilerplate code. 

2. Supports **query derivation**, i.e., methods in repositories can automatically generate queries based on their names.

3. Supports the use of custom `JPQL` or native SQL queries using the `@Query` annotation.

> NOTE: Spring Data JPA eliminates boilerplate code by **dynamically generating proxy instances of the repository interface at runtime**, allowing developers to focus on business logic.
