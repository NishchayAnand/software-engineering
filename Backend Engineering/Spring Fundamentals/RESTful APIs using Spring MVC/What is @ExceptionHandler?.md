`@ExceptionHandler` is a Spring annotation used to handle exceptions thrown during the execution of a controller method.

It allows you to define custom error-handling logic for specific exception types so instead of returning a `500 Internal Server Error`, you can respond with a clean, meaningful error response (like `404`, `409`, etc.) in `JSON`.
