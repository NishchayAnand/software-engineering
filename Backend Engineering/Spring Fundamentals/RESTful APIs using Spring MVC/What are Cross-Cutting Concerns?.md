**Definition (in simple terms):** Cross-cutting concerns are features or behaviors that are used across multiple layers or components of your application but are not part of the core business logic of any one of them.

They “cut across” multiple modules, meaning you’d otherwise have to repeat the same code in many places (controllers, services, etc.) if you didn’t centralize it.
