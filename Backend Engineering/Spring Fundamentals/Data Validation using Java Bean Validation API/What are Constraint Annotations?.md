Validating user input is a super common requirement in most applications, and the Java Bean Validation framework has become the de facto standard for handling this kind of logic.

JSR 380 is a specification of the Java API for bean validation, part of Jakarta EE and JavaSE. It ensures that the properties of a bean meet specific criteria, using annotations such as `@NotNull`, `@Min`, and `@Max`.
