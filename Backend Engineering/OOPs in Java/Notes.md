# What is Object-Oriented Programming?

| Concept              | Description | How They Work Together                                                                                                                              |

| **4 Pillars of OOP** | Foundation  | Provide the **basic constructs** (e.g., inheritance, interfaces) that make SOLID principles and patterns possible                                   |
| **SOLID Principles** | Guidelines  | Help you **apply OOP pillars wisely**. For example: use **abstraction** + **SRP** to break code into smaller, maintainable units                    |
| **Design Patterns**  | Solutions   | Build on **OOP & SOLID**. For example: the **Strategy Pattern** applies **Open/Closed** & **Liskov Substitution** principles using **polymorphism** |

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm based on the ideology of representing real-world entities through self-contained units, each encapsulating its own state (attributes or fields describing the entity) and behavior (methods that allow users to operate on the entity).

Object-Oriented approach of programming offers a more intuitive and structured way of designing and organizing code, making it suitable for building large and complex applications.

The key building blocks of OOPs include:

- **Classes:** serves as a blueprint for creating self-contained units.
- **Objects:** an instance of a class, representing a self-contained unit possessing its own attributes and methods.

The four principles of OOPs – `Inheritance`, `Polymorphism`, `Abstraction`, and `Encapsulation` – serve as the **foundational pillars** that contribute to the creation of well-structured, reusable, and maintainable code.

EXTRA:

- Classes encapsulate fine-grained concepts of a problem and solution, whereas objects represent instances of classes created during the runtime operation of a system.
