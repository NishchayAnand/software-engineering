The `SpringApplication.run(MySpringBootApplication.class, args)` method is used to launch the Spring Boot application. Here's a detailed breakdown of what actually happens:

1. Initializes an **ApplicationContext**. 

2. Scans the base package (and its sub-packages) where **MySpringBootApplication.class** is located for components (like `@Controller`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Component`, etc.) and registers them in the **ApplicationContext**.

3. Scans the classpath and applies default configurations based on the dependencies. For example, if `spring-boot-starter-web` is present, it configures an embedded web server.

4. Blocks the main thread so that the application continues running, serving requests if it's a web application, or processing tasks if it's a standalone application.
