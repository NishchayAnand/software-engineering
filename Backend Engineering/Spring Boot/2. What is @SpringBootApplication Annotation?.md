The `@SpringBootApplication` annotation is a key annotation in Spring Boot that <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">marks a class as the main configuration class and entry point for a Spring Boot application</span>. It is a composite annotation that combines three crucial annotations:

- `@EnableAutoConfiguration`: Part of SpringBoot framework. <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">Automatically configures the Spring application context based on the dependencies on the classpath</span>. For example, if `spring-boot-starter-web` is on the classpath, it configures a web application context.

- `@Configuration`: Part of Spring Framework. <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">Indicates that the class contains Spring bean definitions</span>.

- `@ComponentScan`: Part of Spring framework. <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">Automatically scans the package where the annotated class is located and its sub-packages for Spring components to register them as beans in the Spring application context</span>.

> **NOTE:** The `@SpringBootApplication` annotation simplifies configuration in a Spring Boot project by eliminating the need to declare these annotations individually.
