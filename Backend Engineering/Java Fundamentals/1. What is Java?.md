Java is a **platform-independent** (write once, run anywhere) **object-oriented** (class-based) programming language with **garbage collection** (automatic memory management), **strong** (static) typing, and a **comprehensive standard library**.

### Platform-Independent

The Java source code is compiled into an intermediate form called **bytecode** (stored as `.class` file), which runs on the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**. 

Since the JVM is available for many platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux), the same bytecode can run on any of them **without modification**.

---
### Object-Oriented

Allow us to model real-world entities as objects, each **encapsulating** its own **data** (attributes) and **actions** (methods), and use them as the fundamental building blocks for creating complex applications.

---
### Garbage Collection

Java uses a **garbage collector** that runs in the background and removes objects that are no longer in use (have no active references), helping prevent **memory leaks**.

> **NOTE:** Even though Java has automatic garbage collection, it **only collects objects that are unreachable**. If your code keeps a reference to an unused object, it won’t be garbage collected, leading to **increased memory usage** and eventually **OutOfMemoryError**.

---
### Strong Typing

The data type of each variable needs to be **declared explicitly** so that the compiler can perform type checking at compile time, catching potential errors early in the development process and preventing runtime issues.

---
### Comprehensive Standard Library

Provides a **rich and extensive standard library** that covers everything from data structures, file I/O, networking, and multithreading, all available out of the box. This enables developers to write powerful applications without relying heavily on third-party libraries.

It is largely **open-source**, with **OpenJDK** being the official reference implementation.

> **OpenJDK (Open Java Development Kit):**  An open-source implementation of the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) that includes the **Java compiler (javac)**, **Java Virtual Machine**, and the **core libraries** used to build Java applications.
