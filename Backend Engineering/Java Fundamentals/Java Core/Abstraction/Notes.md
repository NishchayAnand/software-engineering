# Understanding Abstraction in Java

The idea behind Abstraction is to create a simplified view (abstraction) of an object, hiding the complexities of its internal workings.

Abstraction can be implemented using two primary mechanisms in Java:

- **Abstract Classes:** Provide a way to create a foundation (blueprint) for a group of related classes. They enforce a common structure and behavior while allowing for flexibility in how subclasses implement specific functionalities.

- **Interfaces:** Provide a way to define a contract that specify the functionalities (methods) a class must provide, but they don't dictate how those functionalities are implemented.
