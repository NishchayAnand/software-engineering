# Java Persistence API (JPA) Interview Questions

Q. What is JPA (Java Persistence API)?

Java Persistence API (JPA) is a standard specification in Java that defines a set of rules and interfaces for object-relational mapping (ORM) and data persistence. It allows developers to **automatically map Java objects (entities) to database tables** and **handle database operations without writing explicit SQL queries**.

---

Q. What is Hibernate?

Hibernate is a Java-based **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that implements JPA** and extends its functionality with additional features.

---

Q. Explain DAO (Data Access Object) pattern.

The Data Access Object (or DAO) pattern is a structural design pattern used to separate a data resource's client interface from its data access mechanisms. This allows data access mechanisms to change independently of the code that uses the data.

> NOTE: DAO can be used when working with a simple application where complexity of domain logic is low, i.e., when direct database operations like CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are the primary concern. 

---

Q. Explain DTO (Data Transfer Object).

A Data Transfer Object (DTO) is a plain object designed to carry data between layers or across systems. It is not tied to any database or persistence logic and typically lacks behavior (i.e., it only contains getters and setters).

> NOTE: A DTO simply holds data and doesn’t require a unique identifier (e.g., a primary key).

---

Q. What is an Entity?

An Entity represents a real-world object or concept that has a distinct identity and is typically mapped to a row in a database table. This mapping can be done manually or with an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool.

> NOTE: Each entity instance is uniquely identifiable, typically using a primary key (e.g., id in a database).

---

Q. What is an EntityManager?

An EntityManager is responsible for managing the lifecycle of entities (domain objects that are mapped to database tables).

---

Q. What is a Persistance Context?

The EntityManager maintains a persistence context (essentially a cache or memory area) during a transaction. 

The persistence context keeps track of the state of entities (new, managed, detached, or removed). The entities in the persistence context are synchronized with the database when the transaction is committed.

> NOTE: The persistence context is created when the EntityManager is instantiated. In a Spring Boot application, this typically happens with each HTTP request (if using Spring's `@Transactional` support).

---

Q. What is an EntityManagerFactory?

EntityManager is closely tied to a specific transaction. Each EntityManager typically represents a unit of work (a single transaction).

A single EntityManager instance cannot be shared safely across multiple threads. Each thread that requires interaction with the database (such as saving or updating an entity) needs its own EntityManager instance to ensure thread safety.

An EntityManagerFactory is responsible for creating EntityManager instances.

> NOTE: In a Spring Boot application, Spring automatically configures and manages the EntityManagerFactory, so you typically don’t need to create it manually.

Q. Explain common JPA annotations.

1. **Entity Mapping:**

    - `@Entity`: Marks a class as an entity.
    - `@Table`: Specifies the table name (optional, defaults to class name).

2. **Field Mapping:**

    - `@Id`: Marks the primary key.
    - `@GeneratedValue`: Specifies how the primary key value is generated.
    - `@Column`: Customizes the column mapping.

3. **Relationships:**

    - `@OneToOne`, `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`, `@ManyToMany`: Define relationships between entities.
    - `@JoinColumn`: Specifies the foreign key column.

---

Q. Explain the difference between `GenerationType.AUTO` and `GenerationType.IDENTITY`.

- `GenerationType.AUTO`: Allows the persistence provider (e.g., Hibernate) to automatically choose the best strategy for primary key generation based on the underlying database and JPA provider defaults. **The actual strategy chosen can vary depending on the database type and its capabilities**.

- `GenerationType.IDENTITY`: Explicitly instructs the database to generate the primary key value using an auto-increment column, where the database automatically generates the next available key for each new row. **This strategy requires that the underlying database supports auto-increment functionality**.

---

Q. Explain unidirectional relationship.

In a unidirectional relationship, only one entity maintains a reference to the other entity. This means:

- **Owning Entity**: The entity that knows about the relationship and contains the foreign key.

- **Referenced Entity**: The entity that does not maintain any reference back to the owning entity.

The referenced entity is unaware of the relationship, making it a one-way association.

---

Q. Explain bidirectional relationship.

A bidirectional relationship in JPA is a two-way association between two entities where both entities are aware of each other. This means:

- **Owning Entity**: One entity is designated as the "owner" of the relationship, responsible for managing and updating the foreign key in the database.

- **Inverse Entity**: The other entity references the relationship using a `mappedBy` attribute, which links it back to the owning side.

This type of relationship allows navigation in both directions, from one entity to the other and vice versa.

> NOTE: The value of `mappedBy` should match the field name in the owning entity.

---

Q. What are the benefits of bidirectional relationship?

With bidirectional mapping, you can ensure consistency between the parent and child object. Both sides of the relationship are synchronized, which helps avoid data integrity issues. 

For example, deleting a Movie should also delete all associated Shows (cascading behavior).

---

Q. What are the disadvantages of bidirectional relationship?

During serialization (e.g., to JSON), bidirectional relationships can cause infinite loops unless properly handled.

---

Q. Discuss the rules that must be followed while defining a bidirectional relationship.

1. The inverse side of a bidirectional relationship must refer to its owning side by using the `mappedBy` attribute of the `@OneToOne`, `@OneToMany`, or `@ManyToMany` annotation.

2. The many side of many-to-one bidirectional relationships must not define the `mappedBy` attribute. The many side is always the owning side of the relationship.

3. For one-to-one bidirectional relationships, the owning side corresponds to the side that contains the corresponding foreign key.

4. For many-to-many bidirectional relationships, either side may be the owning side.

---

Q. Explain `@JoinColumn` annotation. 

The `@JoinColumn` annotation in JPA is used to **specify the foreign key column** for a relationship between two entities. It is **applied on the owning side** of the relationship and **defines how the association is represented and stored in the underlying database**.

 Below are the key attributes of `@JoinColumn` and their explanations:

 - **name**: Specifies the name of the foreign key column in the owning entity's table. Defaults to `{fieldName}_id`.

 - **referencedColumnName**: Specifies the column in the referenced (target) entity table. Defaults to the primary key column of the referenced entity.

---

Q. Explain `@Embedded` annotation.

The `@Embedded` annotation in JPA is used to indicate that an instance of one class (an embedded object) is part of an entity, and its fields are mapped directly to the database table of the entity.

The class being embedded does not have its own table, its attributes are mapped as columns in the table of the entity in which it is embedded.

---

Q. What is JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language)?

JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) is a query language used to interact with relational databases in Java applications that use JPA (Java Persistence API). It allows developers to create queries using the entity model defined in their Java code, rather than using direct SQL queries on the database.

**NOTE:** JPQL is database-agnostic, meaning the same JPQL query should work across different relational databases as long as they are properly mapped with JPA.

---

Q. Will the following query: `SELECT DISTINCT m FROM Movie m JOIN m.shows s WHERE s.theatre.city = :city")` work if the `Movie` entity does not have a `List<Show> shows` field?

JPQL relies on the mappings defined in your JPA entities to construct queries. If `Movie` does not have a relationship with `Show` (e.g., `@OneToMany` with `List<Show>`), the path expression `m.shows` is invalid because JPQL cannot navigate to the `Show` entity from `Movie`.
