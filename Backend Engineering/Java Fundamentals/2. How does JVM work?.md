While the primary purpose of JVM is to execute Java bytecode, its undertakes a range of preparatory tasks before actual execution takes place. These preparatory tasks are essential for ensuring the smooth and secure execution of your program.

Here's a quick breakdown of what JVM does when you execute a command like `java HelloWorld` in your terminal:

- **Loading:** Looks for the `HelloWorld.class` in the project's CLASSPATH (by default, the directory where the corresponding `HelloWorld.java` file resides) and loads the bytecode from the `.class` file into memory.

- **Verification:** Verifies the bytecode to ensure it adheres to certain rules. This process helps prevent potential security vulnerabilities (such as illegal access to memory or unauthorized system resource access) and ensures the safety and stability of the runtime environment.

- **Memory Allocation:** Divides the available memory into distinct regions to store different data types during program execution. Some common regions include:

  - **Heap:** This is a dynamically allocated space where objects are created during program execution. The size of the allocated memory here can vary depending on the object's type and data.
  - **Stack:** This is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure that stores temporary data like function call arguments, local variables within functions, and return addresses. The stack grows and shrinks as functions are called and return.
  - **Data Segment:** This region stores statically allocated global and static variables that are initialized with a value before program execution.
  - **Code Segment:** This region stores the program's machine code instructions that the CPU executes. This memory is typically read-only.

- **Execution**: Instructs the Execution Engine (could be an `interpreter`, `Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler` or a combination of both) to translate the bytecode into machine code that the underlying hardware's CPU can understand and execute.
