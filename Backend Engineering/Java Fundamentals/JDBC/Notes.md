# Understanding JDBC

JDBC has simplified data access in Java applications. Not only it provided independence from database vendor lock-in, but we also have a standard API to access multitude of databases.

JDBC abstracts away the intricacies involved in accessing different databases.

The steps involved in using JDBC are always the same - obtain a connection, create a `Statement`, execute a query, run it through `ResultSet`, and release the resources.

The programmer using plain JDBC is responsible for:

1. Loading the correct database driver.
2. Creating and closing the connections to the database.
3. Creating SQL statements according to the dialect in use and executing them.
4. Handle the transactions.
5. Treating the exceptions.

When writing JDBC code, make sure to take care of the following points:

1. Proper **resource management (creating and closing connections and statements).**
2. Catch all the `SQLException` **(both in creation and destruction processes).**

- JDBC returns a `ResultSet` and we need to map each and every column data from the `ResultSet` into our domain objects.

> NOTE: `execute()` methods are usually used for running Data Definition Language (DDL) statements easily.

There are two parts in any JDBC client program: one part gets the connection, creates the statement, and deals with resource management, which is more or less a boilerplate code. The other part is the heart of the application where we code the business logic.

Frameworks like Spring Data hides away the non-business code effeciently in the templates while allowing us to concentrate on the business logic.

> **_NOTE:_** The database driver translates the retrieved data structure into a ResultSet object within your Java application. The retrieved data structure is generally an internal, intermediate format specific to the database driver.

Use `executeUpdate()` for executing `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements.
