# Understanding Static Keyword

Static keyword can be used to define class variables and methods.

When you use static fields and methods, you're usually bypassing object-oriented programming altogether. That's often a bad idea but it can be useful in some circumstances.

> **_NOTE:_** Subclasses in Java cannot override static methods.
