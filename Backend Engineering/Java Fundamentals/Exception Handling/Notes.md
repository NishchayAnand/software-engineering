# Understanding Exception Handling in Java

An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program, that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.

> NOTE: The term exception is shorthand for the phrase **"exceptional event."**

When an error occurs within a method, the method creates an object and hands it off to the runtime system. The object, called an `exception` object, contains information about the error, including its type and the state of the program when the error occurred.

**Creating an exception object and handing it to the runtime system is called throwing an exception.**

After a method throws an exception, the runtime system attempts to find something to handle it. It searches the call stack for a method that contains a block of code that can handle the exception. This block of code is called an `exception handler`.

If the runtime system exhaustively searches all the methods on the call stack without finding an appropriate exception handler, the runtime system terminates.

If the methods in an interface declare exceptions, any code calling methods on a reference of that type (interface type) must handle or declare the exceptions.

If your superclass constructor throws an exception, you have no choice but to declare that your constructor also throws an exception.

## Advantages of Exceptions

1. **Separates error handling code from regular code.**
2. **Allows us to propagate error reporting up the call stack of methods.**

## Catch or Specify Requirements

The code that might throw certain exceptions must be enclosed by either of the following:

- A `try` statement that catches the exception.
- A method that specifies that it can throw the exception. The method must provide a `throws` clause that lists the exception.

Code that fails to honor the Catch or Specify Requirement will not compile.

## Types of Exceptions

The Three Kinds of Exceptions: `Checked`, `Error`, `Runtime`.

> NOTE: `Errors` and `runtime` exceptions are collectively known as `unchecked` exceptions.

## User Defined Exceptions

**If a client can reasonably be expected to recover from an exception, make it a checked exception. If a client cannot do anything to recover from the exception, make it an unchecked exception.**

> **_NOTE:_ Always think of exception handling from client's perspective.**
