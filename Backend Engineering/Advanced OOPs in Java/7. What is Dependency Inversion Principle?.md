The **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** states that:

- **High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.** This simply means <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">"All the code in your system should depend on abstractions (interfaces), not on concrete implementations"</span>. 

- **Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions**. This means. This simply means <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">"Instead of your abstractions (interfaces) depending on specific implementations, your implementations should depend on interfaces"</span>. 

<span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold;">Bad Design</span>

In a traditional setup, you might see something like this:

```
interface PaymentGateway {
    void processPayment(double amount);
}

class PayPalGateway implements PaymentGateway {
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        // process payment via PayPal
    }
}

class CreditcardGateway implements PaymentGateway {
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        // process payment via Credit Card
    }
}
```

```
class PaymentProcessorService {
    PaymentGateway paymentGateway = new PayPalGateway(); // implementation                                                                   tightly coupled!

    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        paymentGateway.processPayment(amount);
    }
}
```

*Here:*
- *`PaymentProcessorService` is a high-level module (business logic).*
- *`PayPalGateway` is a low-level module (technical detail).*

Even though we're using the **`PaymentGateway`** interface, the **`PaymentProcessorService`** is still directly instantiating a concrete class, i.e., <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">the high-level module is directly depending on the low-level module</span>. 

If we want to switch to `CreditcardGateway`, we **can't** without modifying `ReportService`.

<span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold;">Solution</span>

Rather than instantiating the dependency (`PaymentGateway paymentGateway`) inside the `PaymentProcessorService` class, provide it from outside by passing it through the constructor.

```
class PaymentProcessorService {
    private PaymentGateway paymentGateway

    ReportService(PaymentGateway paymentGateway) {
        this.paymentGateway = paymentGateway;
    }

    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        paymentGateway.processPayment(amount);
    }
}
```

This approach allows `PaymentProcessorService` to depend only on the abstraction: `PaymentGateway`, making it flexible, decoupled, and compliant with the **Dependency Inversion Principle**.

### What is Dependency Injection?

**Dependency Injection (DI)** is a design pattern used to implement **DIP in object-oriented programming**. 

In DI, high-level classes (**consumers**) do not create or manage the objects they depend on. Instead, they simply declare the interfaces (abstractions) they require. 

The responsibility of creating and supplying the actual implementations of these dependencies is delegated to a separate component, commonly known as the **injector**. This injector injects the dependency objects into the consumer at runtime, ensuring that the consumer receives the exact dependency it needs without being concerned with how it is created or managed (**loosely coupled**).

| Type                      | How It Works                                       | When to Use                                                                                               |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Constructor Injection** | Pass the dependency via the class constructor.     | When the dependency is required for the object to function (**best practice**).                           |
| **Setter Injection**      | Pass the dependency via a public setter method.    | When the dependency is optional or may change after object creation.                                      |
| **Field Injection**       | Inject the dependency directly into a class field. | Often used with frameworks (e.g., Spring), but **not recommended for pure OOP as it hides dependencies.** |

## EXTRA

This principle enforces the use of **Abstract Factories**, i.e., `Factory Pattern` promotes Dependency Inversion Principle.
