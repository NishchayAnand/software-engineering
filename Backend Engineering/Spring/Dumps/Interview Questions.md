# Spring Interview Questions

Q. Explain **`@RestController`** annotation.

The **`@RestController`** annotation is designed to simplify the creation of RESTful web services. <span style="color: red">It combines the functionality of <strong>@Controller</strong> and <strong>@ResponseBody</strong> into a single annotation.</span>

- **`@Controller`**: Marks the class as a <span style="color: green">Spring MVC controller that can handle HTTP requests</span> in a web application. 

- **`@ResponseBody`**: <span style="color: green">Automatically serialises the returned object of a controller method into JSON or XML</span> (depending on the content type in the request header) and writes it directly to the HTTP response body.

> NOTE: Works seamlessly with Spring’s HTTP message converters, such as **Jackson** for JSON serialisation.

---

Q. Explain **`@RequestMapping`** annotation.

The **`@RequestMapping`** annotation in Spring MVC is used to <span style="color: red">map HTTP requests to handler methods</span> in a controller. 

> **NOTE:** <span style="color: green">Can be used at both the <strong>class level</strong> and <strong>method level</strong></span> to define hierarchical mappings.

---

Q. Explain `@GetMapping` annotation.

The `@GetMapping` annotation in Spring MVC is a specialized version of `@RequestMapping` that **simplifies mapping HTTP GET requests to specific handler methods**.

> NOTE: Use `@GetMapping("/example")` instead of `@RequestMapping(value="/example", method = RequestMethod.GET)` to make the code more concise and readable.

---

Q. Explain `@RequestBody` annotation.

The `@RequestBody` annotation in Spring MVC is used to **map the HTTP request body to a Java object**. 

> NOTE: Works with `HttpMessageConverter` to automatically bound the data in the HTTP request body to the fields of the Java object (based on property names).

---

Q. Explain `@Autowired` annotation.

The `@Autowired` annotation in Spring is used to **automate the dependency injection process**. It's a declarative way to instruct Spring to automatically resolve and inject a bean into a class. It can be used on fields, constructors and setter methods.

> NOTE: By default, `@Autowired` performs injection by type. 

---

Q. "Field Injection using `@Autowired` makes the class mutable, increasing the risk of unintended side effects during testing or debugging." Explain.

When you use field injection, the injected **dependencies** cannot be declared as `final` because they **are assigned by the Spring container after the object is created**. Without `final`, there's no guarantee that the dependency won't be reassigned or modified accidentally elsewhere in the code.

When testing a class with field injection, dependencies are typically injected using reflection or test utilities. These tools bypass normal object initialization, which can lead to unexpected behavior or unintentional overwriting of dependencies during tests.

---

Q. How does Constructor Injection using `@Autowired` promotes immutability?

Constructor injection ensures that all dependencies are explicitly defined and provided during object creation. This approach allows the class to declare its dependencies as `final`, making the object immutable and enhancing its reliability.

---

Q. Explain `@Qualifier` annotation.

By default, `@Autowired` performs injection by type. However, when multiple beans of the same type exist, Spring cannot decide which one to inject and throws an exception. The `@Qualifier` annotation helps specify the exact bean to be used.

> NOTE: Use `@Qualifier` with the `@Autowired` annotation to explicitly specify which bean to inject.

---


Q. Explain `@Valid` annotation.

The `@Valid` annotation is part of the **Java Bean Validation API (JSR 303/JSR 380)** and is used to trigger validation on an object or a group of objects. 

It is commonly used in Spring applications to validate method arguments, particularly in web controllers and service layers.

---

Q. Explain `@NotNull` annotation.

The `@NotNull` annotation is a validation constraint used to ensure that a field, method parameter, or method return value is not null. If the element is null, a validation error is triggered.

---

Q. What is `ResponseEntity` class?

By default, Spring's `@RestController` annotation automatically adds the return value of a controller method to the body of the HTTP response. However, if you need more control (e.g., setting headers or status codes), you can use `ResponseEntity` instead of returning the object directly.

The `ResponseEntity` class allows you to control every aspect of an HTTP response, including the status code, headers, and body. 

--- 

Q. What is `BindingResult` interface?

In Spring Framework, `BindingResult` is an interface used in conjunction with form validation (e.g., `@Valid`, `@validate`) to capture the results of binding and validation errors. 

It provides details about validation errors (e.g., `MethodArgumentNotValidException`) that occur when mapping request data (e.g., JSON, form inputs) to a model or DTO object. Using `BindingResult`, you can handle these errors gracefully without triggering exceptions.

> NOTE: If you're not performing manual validation handling (e.g., you rely on `@ExceptionHandler` to catch `MethodArgumentNotValidException`), you may not need to use `BindingResult` directly.

---

Q. Explain `@ExceptionHandler` annotation.

The `@ExceptionHandler` annotation in Spring is used to define a method that will handle exceptions thrown in your application. 

It is part of Spring’s exception-handling framework and is commonly used in controllers to provide custom responses when specific exceptions occur.

---

Q. Explain the difference between Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux.

- **Spring MVC**: Spring MVC is built on the Servlet API and uses a synchronous blocking I/O architecture with a one-request-per-thread model.

- **Spring WebFlux**: Spring WebFlux is a non-blocking web framework built from the ground up to take advantage of multi-core, next-generation processors and handle massive numbers of concurrent connections.

---

Q. What are the disadvantages of Spring MVC?

Spring MVC is built on the Servlet API and uses a synchronous blocking I/O architecture with a one-request-per-thread model.

A thread is tied up for the duration of the request-response cycle. This can lead to scalability challenges in high-concurrency environments as the number of threads increases.
