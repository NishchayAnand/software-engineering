# Understanding @Autowired Annotation

The `@Autowired` annotation in Spring is used to automate the dependency injection process. It's a declarative way to instruct Spring to automatically resolve and inject a bean into a class. 

## How to Use

1. **Field Injection (Least Recommended)**: Field-injected dependencies are not `final`, meaning they can be modified after the object is created. This makes the class mutable, increasing the risk of unintended side effects during testing or debugging.

```
@Service
public class UserService {

    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    public User findUserById(Long id) {
        return userRepository.findById(id).orElse(null);
    }
}
```

2. **Constructor Injection (Recommended Approach)**: It promotes immutability, simplifies testing, and ensures that all dependencies are explicitly defined and provided during object creation.

```
@Service
public class UserService {

    private final UserRepository userRepository;

    @Autowired
    public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }

    public User findUserById(Long id) {
        return userRepository.findById(id).orElse(null);
    }
}
```

3. **Setter Injection**: Allows dependencies to be reassigned, increasing the risk of unintended side effects during runtime. This makes the object mutable and less thread-safe.

```
@Service
public class UserService {

    private UserRepository userRepository;

    @Autowired
    public void setUserRepository(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }

    public User findUserById(Long id) {
        return userRepository.findById(id).orElse(null);
    }
}
```

## How it Works

During the bean initialization process, Spring scans your application context. It identifies beans that match the type of the dependency. If there's a unique match, Spring injects that bean into your class.
