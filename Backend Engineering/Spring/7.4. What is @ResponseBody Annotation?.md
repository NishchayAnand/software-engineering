Methods can be annotated with `@ResponseBody` annotation to indicate that the **return value of a method should be written directly to the HTTP response body** instead of being treated as a view name. The return value of the method (often an object or data structure) gets serialized (e.g., JSON, XML) and sent back to the client as the response body.

Here's a sample code using `@ResponseBody` annotation:

```
@Controller
public class MyController {

  @GetMapping("/data")
  @ResponseBody
  public List<Product> getProducts() {
    // Fetch product data from a service or repository
    List<Product> products = ...;
    return products;
  }
}
```

> **NOTE:** When you include Spring Boot in your project, it automatically configures the `Jackson` library to convert Java objects to `JSON` by default.
