The **`@Controller`** annotation is a specialized form of `Component` annotation, provided by **Spring MVC** to define classes that can handle **HTTP requests**.

Methods in a Controller class typically handle the request logic, retrieve data, and then return a response to the client. This response can be:

- A String representing the view name (for rendering HTML templates).
- A ModelAndView object containing both the view name and model data.
- An object or data structure that gets serialized (e.g., JSON) and sent back as the response body (often used for REST APIs).

> **NOTE:** By default, methods in a `@Controller` return a logical view name, which is resolved to an actual view (like a **JSP** or **HTML** page) by a **ViewResolver**.
