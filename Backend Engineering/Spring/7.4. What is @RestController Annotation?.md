The **`@RestController`** annotation is a specialized version of `@Controller` within Spring MVC. It simplifies the development of **RESTful web services** by eliminating the need to annotate each method with `@ResponseBody`.

It is essentially:

```
@RestController = @Controller + @ResponseBody
```

All handler methods automatically have their return values **written directly to the HTTP response body** (`@ResponseBody`), without the need to annotate each method individually.

**Example**

```
@RestController
public class UserController {

    @GetMapping("/user")
    public User getUser() {
        return new User("John", "Doe"); // Automatically converted to JSON
    }
}
```

> **NOTE:** Works seamlessly with Spring’s HTTP message converters, such as **Jackson** for JSON serialisation.
