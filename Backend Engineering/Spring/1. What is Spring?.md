Spring Framework is a popular open-source framework for building enterprise applications in Java. The first version of Spring, released in October 2002, was introduced as a lightweight alternative to J2EE. 

The Spring Framework addressed several key issues associated with J2EE, providing a simpler and more flexible approach to enterprise Java development.

Lets discuss few of the main problems with J2EE that Spring effectively solved.

### Heavyweight Container

EJB followed an all-or-nothing approach, where developers must adopt the entire EJB framework rather than selectively choosing components or features. This made the EJB container heavyweight and less flexible.

Spring introduced a more lightweight and modular ecosystem, splitting each concern into separate sub-frameworks (e.g., `Spring MVC` for web applications, `Spring Data` for data access). 

Spring's architecture allowed developers to pick and choose the specific services they needed for their application, significantly reducing the overhead and complexity associated with the traditional J2EE container.

### Verbose Deployment Descriptors

With J2EE, the developers had to learn and manage separate configuration mechanisms for both web and EJB components.

Spring took a different approach by introducing a unified configuration style. This consistency meant developers only needed to learn one approach for configuring various components (resources, middle-tier objects, web components).

> **NOTE:** While Spring offers a unified approach, it doesn't restrict developers to a single file. They can split configuration across multiple files for better organization, allowing for flexibility and control over the configuration process.

### Restrictive Programming Model

Each EJB required creating a `component` interface, a `home` interface, and a `bean implementation` class. The EJB container would generated the additional classes required to handle functionalities like lifecycle management during deployment. 

Additionally, the EJB container offered no support for managing relationships between EJBs. We had to perform `JNDI` lookups within an EJB to access to another EJB. This introduced extra complexity and boilerplate code in the EJB implementation, making the overall codebase larger and harder to maintain.

Spring simplified this process by using **`POJOs` (Plain Old Java Objects)** and **dependency injection (DI)**, eliminating the need for the complex interface and class structures required by EJBs. 

With Spring, developers could create simple POJOs to encapsulate business logic and then wire them together using DI, which significantly reduced the number of required classes and interfaces.

Additionally, Spring's **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)** provided a declarative way to handle cross-cutting concerns **(aspects)** like **transaction management**, **security**, and **logging** without needing to generate additional classes. This approach kept the codebase smaller, more maintainable, and easier to understand.

> **NOTE:** Spring uses a technique called **weaving at runtime** to apply the aspects to POJOs. This weaving process intercepts method calls or other events within the POJOs and inserts the logic defined in the aspects at the appropriate points (no additional code is generated or added directly to POJOs).

### EXTRA

Spring works on the principle: **Inversion of Control (IOC)**. When using this principle, instead of allowing the app to control the execution, we give control to the Spring Framework. Through configurations, we instruct the framework on how to manage the code we write, which defines the logic of our app.

The IoC container glues Spring components and components of your application to the framework together.

Spring can control instances added to its IoC container, and one of the things it can do is intercept methods that represent the behavior of these instances. This capability is called **aspecting the method**. **Spring AOP** is the most common ways the framework interacts with what your app does.

Also, as part of the Spring Core, you find the **Spring Aspects** functionality. Aspects help Spring intercept and manipulate methods you define in your app.
