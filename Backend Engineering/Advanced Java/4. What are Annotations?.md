**Annotations** are a way to provide extra metadata about your program. Annotations only provide metadata — they have no other effect on execution of the annotated code.

Annotation metadata can be retained at runtime, so that tools can can discover them using reflection and act on use the annotation metadata to make decisions or perform actions.

Annotations are just instructions.  
Dynamic proxies are the mechanism that often implements those instructions **at runtime**, so behavior changes without you writing extra code.
