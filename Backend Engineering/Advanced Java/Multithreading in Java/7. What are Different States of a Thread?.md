A thread in Java goes through **different stages** during its lifecycle, which are defined in the `Thread.State` enum.

---
### NEW

A `Thread` instance has been created but not started **(initial state)**. In other words, there's a `Thread` object, but no thread of execution.

```
Thread t = new Thread(() -> {
    System.out.println("Running...");
});

System.out.println(t.getState()); // Output: NEW
```

---
### RUNNABLE

A thread enters the `RUNNABLE` state **after you call `start()`** on a thread object. In this state, the thread is **ready to run** and just waiting for its chance to be selected for execution.

```
Thread t = new Thread(() -> {
    System.out.println("Running...");
});

t.start();  
System.out.println(t.getState()); // Likely: RUNNABLE (but timing-dependent)
```

> **NOTE:** The thread may be **actively executing**, or **waiting in line** to be executed by the JVM thread scheduler. Internally, Java does not distinguish between **ready** and **running** (both are considered `RUNNABLE`).
