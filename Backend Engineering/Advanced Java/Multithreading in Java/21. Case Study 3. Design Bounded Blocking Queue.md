A queue is a data structure with two fundamental operations:

- `enqueue`: <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">add an element to the tail of the queue</span>
- `dequeue`:  <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">remove an element from the head</span>

In a **single-threaded queue**, capacity conditions are predictable. Hence, methods like `enqueue` or `dequeue` may safely throw exceptions when full / empty. However, in a **multithreaded** queue, because other threads may be modifying the queue at the same time, the state of the queue can change between the time it's checked and when it's accessed.

In **multithreaded systems**, **blocking or non-blocking behaviours with return values or retries** are preferred instead of exceptions.

A **blocking queue** causes a thread to <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">block when you try to add an element when the queue is currently full</span> or <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">to remove an element when the queue is empty</span>.

> **NOTE:** **Blocking queues** are a useful tool for coordinating the work of multiple threads.

### Problem Statement

Design a thread-safe class `BoundedBlockingQueue` that supports the following operations:

- **`void enqueue(int element)`**: adds an element to the queue. If the queue is full, block until space is available.

- **`int dequeue()`**: removes and returns the front element. If the queue is empty, block until an element is available.

- **`int size()`**: returns the number of elements currently in the queue.

> **NOTE:** The implementation will be tested using multiple threads at the same time. Each thread will either be a producer thread that only makes calls to the `enqueue` method or a consumer thread that only makes calls to the `dequeue` method.

### General Observations

To design a **Bounded Blocking Queue** that is safe for use by multiple producer and consumer threads, the key is to manage concurrent access and coordination correctly.

```
Example:

- 3 producer threads (P1, P2, P3)
- 4 consumer threads (C1, C2, C3, C4)
- Queue capacity = 3

Queue operations are called in the following sequence:	
	
	- queue.enqueue(1);  // from P1
	- queue.enqueue(0);  // from P2
	- queue.enqueue(2);  // from P3

	- queue.dequeue();   // by C1
	- queue.dequeue();   // by C2
	- queue.dequeue();   // by C3

	- queue.enqueue(3);  // from P1
	- queue.size();      // expected to return 1
```

> **NOTE:** Even though the code appears sequential, **thread scheduling is non-deterministic**. For example, P3 may call `enqueue(2)` before P1 enqueues `1`.

### Approach 1: `ReentrantLock` + `Condition`

Use a **`ReentrantLock`** to provide mutual exclusion and ensure that only one thread at a time can modify the queue. 

Alongside the lock, define two **`Condition` objects**: 

1. **`notFull`**: A producer calling `enqueue()` will wait on `notFull` if the queue is full. Once a `dequeue()` removes an item, it signals `notFull`, allowing a blocked producer to proceed.

2. **`notEmpty`**: A consumer calling `dequeue()` will wait on `notEmpty` if the queue is empty. Once an `enqueue()` adds an item, it signals `notEmpty`, waking up any waiting consumers.

```
private final Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();  
private final int capacity;  
  
private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();  
private final Condition notFull = lock.newCondition();  
private final Condition notEmpty = lock.newCondition();  
```

```
public BoundedBlockingQueue(int capacity) {  
    this.capacity = capacity;  
}
```

```
public void enqueue(int element) throws InterruptedException {
	lock.lock();  
	try {    
	    while(queue.size() == capacity) {
		    notFull.await(); // wait till the queue is fill
		}
	    queue.offer(element);  
	    notEmpty.signal(); // notify that an item is available in the queue  
	} finally {  
	    lock.unlock();  
	}
}
```

```
public int dequeue() throws InterruptedException {  
    lock.lock();  
    try {  
        while(queue.isEmpty()) {
	        notEmpty.await(); // wait till the queue is empty
	    }
        int value = queue.poll();  
        notFull.signal(); // notify that space is available in the queue  
        return value;  
    } finally {  
        lock.unlock();  
    }  
}
```

```
public int size() {  
    lock.lock();  
    try {  
        return queue.size();  
    } finally {  
        lock.unlock();  
    }  
}
```

### Approach 2: `Semaphore`

We can leverage semaphore’s ability to control access to limited resources (`capacity`) to keep track of the <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">number of available slots</span> and the <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">number of filled slots</span>. The idea is to use two semaphores:

1. **`emptySlots`**: Initialised to the queue’s `capacity`. It tracks how many items can still be added. A producer must acquire from `emptySlots` before adding an item. If the queue is full, the producer **blocks** until a slot is freed.

2. **`filledSlots`**: Initialised to `0`. It tracks how many items are available to consume. A consumer must acquire from `filledSlots` before removing an item. If the queue is empty, the consumer **blocks** until an item is added.

> **NOTE:** Can use a separate `lock` semaphore to ensure that only one thread modifies the queue at a time, avoiding race conditions.

```
private final Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();  
private final int capacity;  
  
private final Semaphore emptySlots;  
private final Semaphore fillSlots = new Semaphore(0);  
private final Semaphore lock = new Semaphore(1); // binary semaphore = lock  
```

```
public BoundedBlockingQueue(int capacity) {  
    this.capacity = capacity;  
    this.emptySlots = new Semaphore(capacity);  
}
```

```
public void enqueue(int element) throws InterruptedException {  
    emptySlots.acquire(); // wait for an empty slot  
    lock.acquire();       // enter critical section  
    queue.offer(element);  
    lock.release();       // exit critical section  
    fillSlots.release();  // signal one item is available in the queue  
}
```

```
  public int dequeue() throws InterruptedException {  
    fillSlots.acquire();    // wait for an available item  
    lock.acquire();         // enter critical section  
    int val = queue.poll();  
    lock.release();         // exit critical section  
    emptySlots.release();   // signal one empty slot is available  
    return val;  
}
```

```
public int size() {  
    lock.acquireUninterruptibly();  
    int size = queue.size();  
    lock.release();  
    return size;  
}
```

> **NOTE:** **`acquireUninterruptibly()`** will **block the thread until it gets the permit**, even if it's interrupted. This is useful when you're doing a small atomic operation (like reading `queue.size()`) and you **don’t want interruption to cause inconsistent behaviour**.
