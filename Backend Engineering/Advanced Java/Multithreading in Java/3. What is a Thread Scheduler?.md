The **JVM thread scheduler** is responsible for selecting the thread to execute next. You can sometimes influence that decision, but you cannot forve a thread to move from **Runnable** to **Running** state. There is not API for calling methods on the scheduler.

Once the thread becomes runnable, it can move back and forth between runnable, running and an additional state: `temporarily not-runnable (a.k.a blocked)`.

The thread scheduler can move a running thread into a blocked state. For example,

1. A thread might be executing code to read from a `Socket` input stream, but there isn't any data to read. The scheduler will move the thread out of the running state until something becomes available.
2. The executing code might have told the thread ot put itself to sleep (`sleep()`).
3. The thread might be waiting on an object which is **locked**. In that case, the thread can't continue until the object's lock is freed by the thread that has it.

> **NOTE:** The scheduler implementations are different for different JVM's, and even running the same program on the same machine can give you different results.
