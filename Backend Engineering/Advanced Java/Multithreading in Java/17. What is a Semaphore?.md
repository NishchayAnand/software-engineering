A **semaphore** is a concurrency control mechanism that manages access to a shared resource by maintaining a **count of available permits**. 

Threads must call `acquire()` to obtain a permit before proceeding, and if no permits are available, they block until one is released. Conversely, calling `release()` adds a permit back to the semaphore, potentially unblocking a waiting thread. 

Unlike locks, semaphores don’t associate permits with specific threads, i.e., **any thread can release a permit**, regardless of which thread acquired it. 

> **NOTE:** There are no actual permit objects; the semaphore simply tracks the number of available permits internally. This makes semaphores particularly useful for controlling access to a limited set of resources (like a fixed-size connection pool) or coordinating thread execution.

### History

**Semaphores** were introduced by **Edsger W. Dijkstra** in **1968** as a fundamental concept in concurrent programming. He proposed them as a **synchronization primitive**, i.e., a low-level building block for controlling access to shared resources and ensuring proper sequencing of operations in **multithreaded or multiprocessing systems**.

Dijkstra originally defined two operations:

- `P` (from the Dutch word `proberen`, meaning to test or to try): corresponds to **acquire()**
- `V` (from `verhogen`, meaning to increment): corresponds to **release()**

These operations allowed processes to **wait** for and **signal** availability of a shared resource, forming the basis for many high-level synchronization tools like:

| Tool                   | Built on Semaphore-Like Concepts      | Purpose                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lock                   | Only 1 permit                         | Ensures **mutual exclusion** — one thread at a time       |
| **Condition Variable** | Waits and signals under a lock        | Allows threads to **wait for conditions**                 |
| **BlockingQueue**      | Uses semaphores internally            | Coordinates **producer-consumer** patterns                |

```
public class Test {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        
        Semaphore sem = new Semaphore(1);

        Runnable task = () -> {
            try {
                sem.acquire();
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + "                                             acquired");
                Thread.sleep(100);
                sem.release();
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + "                                             released");
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
        };

        new Thread(task, "A").start();
        new Thread(task, "B").start();
        
    }
}
```

<span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">Explanation</span>

Only one thread can acquire the permit at a time. The first thread to call `acquire()` will proceed. The other thread waits until the first thread releases the permit.

> **NOTE:** **B can acquire the permit before A**, even if A was started first — because thread scheduling is non-deterministic.

<span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">Output</span>

If A acquires the permit first:

```
A acquired
A released
B acquired
B released
```

else if B acquires first:

```
B acquired
B released
A acquired
A released
```

```
public class Test {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        
        Semaphore sem = new Semaphore(2);

		sem.release();
		sem.release();

		System.out.println("Available permits: " + sem.availablePermits());
        
    }
}
```

<span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">Explanation</span>

**You can call `release()` more times than `acquire()` was ever called.** This is known as **over-releasing**. There is **no built-in upper bound** enforced by the semaphore.

<span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">Output</span>

```
Available permits: 4
```

<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">Q. What will be the output of the following code?</span>

```
public class Test {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        
        Semaphore sem = new Semaphore(0);

		Thread t = new Thread(() -> {
		    try {
		        sem.acquire();
		        System.out.println("Acquired!");
		    } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
		});

		t.start();
		Thread.sleep(100); // Main thread waits a bit
		sem.release();
        
    }
}
```

<span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">Explanation</span>

The thread `t` blocks on `sem.acquire()` because no permit is available initially. Once `sem.release()` is called, the permit is granted (count becomes 1), which **unblocks the waiting thread**.

> **NOTE:** The main thread **sleeps for 100 ms**, giving `t` time to hit `acquire()` and start waiting.

<span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">Output</span>

```
Acquired!
```

> **NOTE:** `Semaphore(0)` is commonly used to **pause a thread until another explicitly signals it**.
