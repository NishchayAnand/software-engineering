# Understanding Parallelism

Parallelism is aided by hardware in the form of multicore processors on individual machines or as computing clusters where several machines are hooked up to solve independent pieces of a problem simultaneously.

**Remember an individual problem has to be concurrent in nature, that is portions of it can be worked on independently without affecting the final outcome before it can be executed in parallel.**

**In parallel systems the emphasis is on increasing throughput and optimizing usage of hardware resources.** The goal is to extract out as much computation speedup as possible.
