The same instance of `Foo` will be passed to three different threads. Thread A will call `first()`, thread B will call `second()`, and thread C will call `third()`.

Design a mechanism and modify the program to ensure that `second()` is executed after `first()`, and `third()` is executed after `second()`.

```
class Foo {

	public Foo() {
	
	}

	public void first(Runnable printFirst) throws InterruptedException {
		// printFirst.run() outputs "first". Do not change or remove this line.
		printFirst.run();
	}

	public void second(Runnable printSecond) throws InterruptedException {
		// printSecond.run() outputs "second". Do not change or remove this line.
		printSecond.run();
	}

	public void third(Runnable printThird) throws InterruptedException {
		// printThird.run() outputs "third". Do not change or remove this line.
	printThird.run();
	}

}
```

### General Observations

The threads can be called in any arbitrary order. We need to ensure that regardless of the order in which the threads run, the output must **always appear in this fixed order:** `first -> second -> third`.

> **NOTE:** Even if the threads are called in the required order `first -> second -> third`, we do not know how the threads will be scheduled in the operating system.

```
Example 1

Input: nums = [1,2,3]

Output: "firstsecondthird"

Explanation: There are three threads being fired asynchronously. The input [1,2,3] means thread A calls first(), thread B calls second(), and thread C calls third(). "firstsecondthird" is the correct output.

Example 2

Input: nums = [1,3,2]

Output: "firstsecondthird"

Explanation: The input [1,3,2] means thread A calls first(), thread B calls third(), and thread C calls second(). "firstsecondthird" is the correct output.
```

### Intuition

The problem simulates a **real-world coordination task**: <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold;background:beige;">Task B must wait until Task A is done, and Task C must wait until Task B is done.</span> This is the core idea of **thread coordination**, i.e., making sure things happen in a **strict sequence**, even in an **unpredictable environment**.

We need to design a mechanism that lets every thread come in whenever it wants, but **hold it back** until the thread it depends on is done processing. In other words, we need to create checkpoints to ensure that:

- `second()` **waits** at a checkpoint until `first()` **signals** it's done.
- `third()` **waits** until `second()` **signals** it's done.

### Approach 1: Using ReentrantLock + Conditions

```
// Create a reentrant lock to control access to the shared state
private Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();  

// Create a Condition object for the t2 thread to wait until t1 is done
private final Condition firstDone = lock.newCondition(); 

// Create a Condition object for the t3 thread to wait until t2 is done
private final Condition secondDone = lock.newCondition();

// Create a shared variable to track which method should execute next
private int state = 1; // 1 = first's turn, 2 = second's turn, 3 = third's turn
```

```
// method to be executed first
public void first(Runnable printFirst) throws InterruptedException {  
    lock.lock(); // Acquire the lock before entering the critical section 
    try {  
        printFirst.run();  
        state = 2; // Update state to indicate second() can now run
        firstDone.signal(); // Wake up the thread waiting to run second() 
    } finally {  
        lock.unlock(); // Release the lock
    }  
}
```

```
// method to be executed second
public void second(Runnable printSecond) throws InterruptedException {  
    lock.lock(); // Acquire the lock before entering the critical section 
    try {  
        while(state != 2) firstDone.await(); // Block this thread until signaled 
        printSecond.run();  
        state = 3; // Update state to indicate third() can now run
        secondDone.signal(); // Wake up the thread waiting to run third()  
    } finally {  
        lock.unlock(); // Release the lock
    }  
}
```

```
// method to be executed third
public void third(Runnable printThird) throws InterruptedException {  
    lock.lock(); // Acquire the lock before entering the critical section 
    try {  
        while(state != 3) secondDone.await();// Block this thread until signaled 
        printThird.run();  
    } finally {  
        lock.unlock(); // Release the lock 
    }  
}
```

```
public static void main(String[] args) {  
    Foo foo = new Foo();  
  
    Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {  
        try {  
            foo.first(() -> System.out.print("first"));  
        } catch (InterruptedException _) {}  
    });  
  
    Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {  
        try {  
            foo.second(() -> System.out.print("second"));  
        } catch (InterruptedException _) {}  
    });  
  
    Thread t3 = new Thread(() -> {  
        try {  
            foo.third(() -> System.out.print("third"));  
        } catch (InterruptedException _) {}  
    });  
  
    t1.start();  
    t2.start();  
    t3.start();  
}  
```

### Approach 2: Using synchronization + wait / notify

```
// Create a shared variable to track which method should execute next
private int state = 1; // 1 = first's turn, 2 = second's turn, 3 = third's turn
```

```
// method to be executed first
public synchronized void first(Runnable printFirst) throws InterruptedException {
    printFirst.run();
    state = 2; // Update state to indicate second() can now run
    notifyAll(); // Notify all waiting threads (in case second or third is                                                       waiting)
}
```

```
// method to be executed second
public synchronized void second(Runnable printSecond) throws InterruptedException {
    while (state != 2) wait(); // Block this thread until signaled 
    printSecond.run(); 
    state = 3; // Update state to indicate third() can now run
    notifyAll(); // Notify all waiting threads (in case third is waiting)
}
```

```
// method to be executed third
public synchronized void third(Runnable printThird) throws InterruptedException {
    while (state != 3) wait(); // Block this thread until signaled 
    printThird.run();
}
```
