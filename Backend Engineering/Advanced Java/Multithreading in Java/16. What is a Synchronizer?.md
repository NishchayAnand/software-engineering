The `java.util.concurrent` package contains several classes that help manage a set of collaborating threads. These mechanisms have **canned functionality** for common rendezvous patterns between threads. 

| Class            | What It Does                                                                                                                                      | When To Use                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CyclicBarrier    | Allows a set of threads to wait until a predefined count of them has reached a common barrier, and then optionally executes a barrier action.<br> | When a number of threads need to complete before their results can be used.                                                                                         |
| CountDownLatch   | Allows a set of threads to wait until a count has been decremented to 0.                                                                          | When one or more threads need to wait until a specified number of results are available.                                                                            |
| Exchanger        | Allows two threads to exchange objects when both are ready for the exchange.                                                                      | When two threads work on two instances of the same data structure, one by filling an instance and the other by emptying the other.                                  |
| SynchronousQueue | Allows a thread to hand off an object to another thread.                                                                                          | To send an object from one thread to another when both are ready, without explicit synchronization.                                                                 |
| **Semaphore**    | **Allows a set of threads to wait until permits are available for proceeding.**                                                                   | **To restrict the total number of threads that can access a resource. <br><br>If permit count is one, use to block threads until another thread gives permission.** |

> **NOTE:** If you have a set of collaborating threads that follows one of these **behaviour patterns**, you should simply reuse the appropriate library class instead of trying to come up with a handcrafted collection of locks.
