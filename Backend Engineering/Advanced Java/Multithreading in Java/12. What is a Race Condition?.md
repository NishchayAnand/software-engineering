A **race condition** arises when two or more threads access shared data **at the same time**, and at least one of the threads **modifies** that data.

The key problem is that the **outcome of operations depends on the unpredictable timing** and interleaving of thread execution. In other words, <span style="color:green;">the program's behaviour is no longer deterministic, it may produce different results on different runs, even if the input remains the same.</span>

Race conditions typically occur during a sequence of operations that should be atomic (executed as a single, uninterruptible unit), but in reality, they’re executed separately. This separation allows **other threads to interfere between those steps**, potentially leading to unexpected or incorrect results.

<span style="color:cyan;font-weight:bold;">Example: ATM Withdrawal</span>

Two people (Alice and Bob) try to <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">withdraw</span> `₹5,000` each from the same <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">bank account</span> with `₹10,000`. Both ATMs <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">check the balance</span> at the same time, see enough funds, and proceed to <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">withdraw</span>. 

```
class BankAccount {
    private int balance = 10000;

    public void withdraw(int amount) {
	    String accountHolder = Thread.currentThread().getName();
        if (balance >= amount) {
            System.out.println(accountHolder + " about to withdraw ₹" + amount);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(100); // Simulate delay - thread might be                                                 deactivated at this point
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            balance -= amount;
            System.out.println(accountHolder + " completed withdrawal. Remaining                                balance: ₹" + balance);
        } else {
            System.out.println(accountHolder + " tried to withdraw but                                          insufficient balance!");
        }
    }

    public int getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}
```

```
public class RaceConditionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount();

        // Create two threads simulating Alice and Bob
        Thread alice = new Thread(() -> account.withdraw(5000), "Alice");
        Thread bob = new Thread(() -> account.withdraw(5000), "Bob");

        alice.start();
        bob.start();
    }
}
```

<span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">Sample Output</span>
	
```
Alice is about to withdraw ₹5000
bob is about to withdraw ₹5000
bob completed withdrawal. Remaining balance: ₹5000
Alice completed withdrawal. Remaining balance: ₹5000
```

<span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">Explanation</span>

Because **memory updates take time** and the **operations (check, deduct, update)** aren’t atomic, both transactions use the same initial balance. This results in an incorrect final balance of ₹`5,000` instead of `₹0` (one deduction is lost).

<span style="color:yellow">(explore this) It is entirely possible that the current thread will be deactivated between the successful outcome of the test and the call to transfer. By the time the thread is running again, the account balance may have fallen below the withdrawal amount</span>

<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">This illustrates a race condition, where multiple threads (or users) access and modify shared data without proper coordination, leading to inconsistent or wrong results.</span>

> **NOTE:** Race conditions may not manifest during development or testing, especially if the system has low load or few threads. However, under production conditions, i.e., with more threads, higher CPU load, or different timing, they can suddenly surface, causing **data corruption**, **incorrect program logic**, or **application crashes**.

### How to Handle Race Conditions?

To prevent race conditions, developers must **coordinate access to shared resources**. This is typically done by:

- <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">Thread Synchronisation</span> - ensure that only one thread accesses critical sections at a time.
- <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">Immutable objects</span> - ensure that shared data can't be modified after creation.
