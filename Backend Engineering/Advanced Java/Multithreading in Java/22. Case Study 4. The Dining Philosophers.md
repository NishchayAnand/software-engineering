**Problem Link:** [Leetcode 1226](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-dining-philosophers/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=concurrency) | **Difficulty:** #Hard

Five silent philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of spaghetti. Forks are placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers.

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/24/an_illustration_of_the_dining_philosophers_problem.png)

Each philosopher thinks for a while, then tries to eat spaghetti. However, a philosopher can only eat when they have both **left** and **right** forks. 

After eating, they need to put down both forks (and start thinking again) so that the forks become available to others. 

> **NOTE:** Eating is not limited by the remaining amounts of spaghetti or stomach space, i.e., an infinite supply and an infinite demand are assumed.

---
### Problem Statement

Each philosopher runs as a separate thread and repeatedly calls the method: **`void wantsToEat(philosopher, pickLeftFork, pickRightFork, eat, putLeftFork, putRightFork)`**. 

```
class DiningPhilosophers {

	public DiningPhilosophers() {}

	// call the run() method of any runnable to execute its code
	public void wantsToEat(
		int philosopher,        // id of the philosopher who wants to eat
		Runnable pickLeftFork,  // function to pick the left fork
		Runnable pickRightFork, // function to pick the right fork
		Runnable eat,           // function to let the philosopher eat once he                                      has picked both forks
		Runnable putLeftFork,   // function to put down the left fork
		Runnable putRightFork   // function to put down the right fork
	) throws InterruptedException {
		...
	}

}
```

Implement the **`wantsToEat()`** function <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">ensuring no philosopher starves, i.e., each can forever continue to alternate between eating and thinking, assuming that no philosopher can know when others may want to eat or think</span>.

> **NOTE:** The philosophers' ids are numbered from **0** to **4** in a **clockwise** order.

### General Observations

The **Dining Philosophers** problem models a situation where multiple threads (**`philosophers`**) must share limited resources (**`forks`**) to perform a task (**`eat`**).

The challenge is to ensure that each philosopher thread repeatedly gets a chance to pick up its left and right forks, eat, and then put down both without without causing:

1. **Race Condition**: Two threads picking the same fork at the same time.

2. **Starvation**: A philosopher might keep trying to eat, but never succeed, i.e., **don't get a fair chance to eat because others keep getting the forks before them**.

3. **Deadlock**: If **all `5` philosophers pick up their left chopstick at the same time**, then no one can acquire their right chopstick. Now everyone is stuck forever, i.e., a **deadlock**.

---
### Intuition

The key requirement is to ensure that no circular dependencies form and that each philosopher eventually gets a fair chance to eat. This involves enforcing <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">mutual exclusion (only one person can use a fork at a time)</span>, <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">avoiding deadlock (someone can always eat)</span>, and <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">ensuring fairness (everyone gets to eat eventually)</span>.

---
### Approach - Using Semaphore

The core idea of the semaphore-based solution is to use **one binary semaphore per fork** to ensure **mutual exclusion** (only one philosopher can use a fork at a time). 

Additionally, a **global counting semaphore initialised to `4`** limits the number of philosophers who can attempt to pick up forks concurrently. This effectively **breaks the possibility of circular waiting**, which is the root cause of **deadlock**. With at most four philosophers picking up forks, at least one can always succeed in acquiring both forks, eat, and release the resources for others to proceed.

This approach not only prevents deadlock but also ensures that no philosopher starves. After a philosopher finishes eating, they release both their forks and the global permit, allowing others to proceed. **Semaphore fairness (first-come-first-served) ensures that every philosopher eventually gets access**. 

```
public void wantsToEat(int philosopher, 
					  Runnable pickLeftFork, 
					  Runnable pickRightFork, 
					  Runnable eat,  
                      Runnable putLeftFork, 
                      Runnable putRightFork) throws InterruptedException {  
  
    int left = philosopher;  
    int right = (philosopher + 1) % 5;  
  
    // Prevent more than 4 philosophers from attempting to eat simultaneously  
    maxEaters.acquire();  
  
    // Acquire both forks  
    forks[left].acquire();  
    forks[right].acquire();  
  
    // Executing eating logic  
    pickLeftFork.run();  
    pickRightFork.run();  
    eat.run();  
    putLeftFork.run();  
    putRightFork.run();  
  
    // Release both forks  
    forks[left].release();  
    forks[right].release();  
  
    // Allow another philosopher to try eating  
    maxEaters.release();  
  
}
```

> **NOTE:** Since **each philosopher needs two forks** to eat, only **`2` philosophers can safely eat in parallel**, provided they are not neighbours.

### Sample Test Code 

```
public static void main(String[] args) {  
    DiningPhilosophers dp = new DiningPhilosophers();  
  
    for(int i=0; i<5; i++) {  
        int philosopher = i;  
        new Thread(() -> {  
            while(true) {  
                try {  
                    dp.wantsToEat(philosopher,  
                            () -> System.out.println(philosopher + " picked up                                     left fork"),  
                            () -> System.out.println(philosopher + " picked up                                     right fork"),  
                            () -> System.out.println(philosopher + " is                                            eating"),  
                            () -> System.out.println(philosopher + " puts down                                     left fork"),  
                            () -> System.out.println(philosopher + " puts down                                     right fork"));  
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {  
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();  
                    break;  
                }  
            }  
        }).start();  
    }  
}
```
