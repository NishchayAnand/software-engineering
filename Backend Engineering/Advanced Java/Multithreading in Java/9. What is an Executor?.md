The **Executors** class has a number of static factory methods for constructing **thread pools**.

**Executors Factory Methods**

| Method                           | Description                                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| newCachedThreadPool              | New threads are created as needed; idle threads are kept for 60 seconds.      |
| newFixedThreadPool               | The pool contains a fixed set of threads; idle threads are kept indefinitely. |
| newSingleThreadExecutor          | A pool with a single thread that executes the submitted tasks sequentially.   |
| newScheduledThreadPool           | A fixed-thread pool for scheduled execution.                                  |
| newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor | A single-thread pool for scheduled execution.                                 |

The `newCachedThreadPool` method constructs a thread pool that executes each task immediately, using an existing idle thread when available and creating a new thread otherwise. 

The `newFixedThreadPool` method constructs a thread pool with a fixed size. If more tasks are submitted than there are idle threads, then the unserved tasks are placed on a queue. They are run when other tasks have completed. 

The `newSingleThreadExecutor` is a degenerate pool of size 1. A single thread executes the submitted tasks, one after another.

> **NOTE:** These three methods return an object of the `ThreadPoolExecutor` class that implements the `ExecutorService` interface.
