When a thread calls the `lock()` method to acquire a lock that is already held by another thread, it becomes **blocked indefinitely** until the lock is released. This blocking behaviour can lead to a critical issue known as **deadlock**, where **two or more threads are permanently blocked**, each waiting for the other to release a lock that they need to proceed. 

Since none of the threads can release their current locks while waiting, **the program reaches a standstill**, and the threads are **stuck forever**, unable to make any progress.

---
### Limitations of using `Lock()` Method

In deadlock-prone or time-sensitive systems, being able to interrupt a blocked thread allows the program to **recover or retry** rather than hanging forever.

However, if a thread is **interrupted** while waiting to acquire a lock through the `lock()` method, it will **not respond to the interruption**. Instead, it remains blocked until the lock becomes available. This behaviour makes `lock()` particularly **risky in deadlock-prone scenarios**, as it offers **no built-in support for interruption or recovery**.

---
### `tryLock` Method

The `tryLock()` method is a non-blocking way to attempt acquiring a lock, which helps **avoid deadlocks** and improve responsiveness in multithreaded programs.

```
Lock myLock = new ReentrantLock();

if (myLock.tryLock()) {
    // Successfully acquired the lock
    try {
        // Critical section (safe to access shared resource)
    } finally {
        myLock.unlock(); // Always release the lock!
    }
} else {
    // Could not acquire the lock — do something else
}
```

The above code tries to **acquire the lock immediately**, without waiting. If the lock is available, it returns `true` and the thread gains access. If the lock is already held by another thread, it returns `false` **without blocking**.

### Limitations of using `tryLock` Method

<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">(below content needs review)</span>

The `tryLock()` method doesn’t honor the waiting order. 

When you call `tryLock()`, it **immediately attempts to acquire the lock**. If the lock is free at that moment, the calling thread gets it, **regardless of whether other threads have been waiting for it longer**. This behaviour is called **barging**.

This can be a **problem** if you care about fairness or preventing thread starvation. A thread that’s been trying repeatedly might never acquire the lock if other threads keep barging in using `tryLock()`.

---
### How to Prevent Barging?

If you want threads to **acquire locks in a fair, first-come-first-served order**, you can:

<span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">Create the Lock in Fair Mode</span>

```
Lock lock = new ReentrantLock(true); // fairness = true
```

This makes the lock fair, and **new threads will not barge ahead** of waiting threads.

<span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">Use</span> `tryLock` <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">Method with a Timeout</span>

```
if (myLock.tryLock(0, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) . . .
```

The `tryLock` method with a timeout parameter respects fairness in the same way as the lock method. 

> **NOTE:** If you call tryLock with a timeout, then an InterruptedException is thrown if the thread is interrupted while it is waiting. This is clearly a useful feature because it allows a program to break up deadlocks.

---
### EXTRA

When you wait on a condition, you can also supply a timeout:

`myCondition.await(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS))`

The await method returns if another thread has activated this thread by calling `signalAll` or `signal`, or if the timeout has elapsed, or if the thread was interrupted.

The await methods throw an `InterruptedException` if the waiting thread is interrupted.
