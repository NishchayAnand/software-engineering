The `ScheduledExecutorService` interface has methods for scheduled or repeated execution of tasks. It is a generalisation of `java.util.Timer` that allows for thread pooling. 

The `newScheduledThreadPool` and `newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor` methods of the `Executors` class return objects that implement the `ScheduledExecutorService` interface.
