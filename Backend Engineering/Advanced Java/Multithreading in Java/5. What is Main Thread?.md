Every Java application starts up a main thread - the thread that puts the main() method on the bottom of the stack. The JVM is responsible for starting the main thread (and other threads, as it chooses, including the garbage collection thread).

As a programmer, you can write code to start other threads of your own.

> **NOTE:** Unless you have multiple processors on your computer, each new Java thread is not actually a separate process runnning on the OS. But it almost feels as though it is.
