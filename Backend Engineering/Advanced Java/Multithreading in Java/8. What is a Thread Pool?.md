Constructing a new thread is somewhat expensive because it involves interaction with the operating system. If your program creates a large number of short-lived threads, then it should instead use a **thread pool**. 

A **thread pool** contains a number of idle threads that are ready to run. You give a `Runnable` to the pool, and one of the threads calls the run method. When the run method exits, the thread doesnâ€™t die but stays around to serve the next request.
