With multithreading, multiple threads can execute different sections of the program. However, all threads share the same heap memory, meaning they can access the same objects.

While each thread runs in its own call stack, they can still interact with shared data. This creates a critical risk:Â **multiple threads accessing and modifying a single shared object simultaneously**. For example, <span style="color:green;">if two threads call setters on the same object without coordination, the data can become inconsistent or corrupted.</span>
