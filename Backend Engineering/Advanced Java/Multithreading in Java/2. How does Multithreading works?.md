With more than one thread, you get the appearance of having multiple things happen at the same time. In reality, the execution between threads move back and forth so rapidly that you feel as though all threads are executing at the same time.

Remember, Java is just a process running on your underlying OS. So first, Java itself has to be the **currently executing process** on the OS. But once Java gets its turn to execute, JVM runs whatever is on the top of the currently-running stack.

> **NOTE:** One of thinngs a thread must do is keep track of which statement (of which method) is currently executing on the thread's stack.

It is possible to have the overhead of context switching among threads steal away any throughput gains and result in worse performance than a single-threaded scenario. However such cases are unlikely and an exception, rather than the norm.
