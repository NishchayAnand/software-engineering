### Use Case 1: Login

```
- Assumption: Daily Active Users (DAU) = 5 Million
- Assumption: 20% of DAU log in per day

- Total Requests per Day = 5M * 20% = 1M
- Average RPS = 1,000,000 / (24 * 60 * 60) ≈ 10 RPS

- Assumption: Peak Load Factor = 5x
- Peak RPS = 10 * 5 ≈ 50 RPS
```

---
### Use Case 2: Search Hotels

```
- Assumption: Daily Active Users (DAU) = 5 Million
- Assumption: Average Search Requests per User per Day = 5

- Total Requests per Day = 5M * 5 = 25M
- Average RPS = 25,000,000 / (86,400) ≈ 250 RPS

- Assumption: Peak Load Factor = 5x
- Peak RPS = 250 * 5 ≈ 1,250 RPS
```

---
### Use Case 3: View Hotel Details

```
- Assumption: 50% of users view details after search
- Assumption: Average View Details Requests per User per Day = 2

- Total Requests per Day = 5M * 50% * 2 = 5,000,000
- Average RPS = 5,000,000 / (86,400) ≈ 50 RPS

- Assumption: Peak Load Factor = 5x
- Peak RPS = 50 * 5 ≈ 250 RPS
```

---
### Use Case 4: Make a Reservation

```
- Assumption: 2% of users make a booking per day
- Assumption: Average Booking Requests per User per Day = 1

- Total Requests per Day = 5M * 2% = 100,000
- Average RPS = 100,000 / (24 * 60 * 60) ≈ 1 RPS

- Assumption: Peak Load Factor = 5x
- Peak RPS = 1 * 5 = 5 RPS
```
