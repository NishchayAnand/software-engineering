The **Attendance Management System (AMS)** can be designed using a **Layered Architecture**. This approach organizes the system into **distinct layers (Controller–Service–Repository)**, allowing each layer to focus on a single responsibility.

Additionally, we can leverage **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** to model real-world entities such as **`Teacher`**, **`SchoolClass`**, and **`Student`** as objects, encapsulating both their data and behaviors. This makes the system more intuitive by aligning the software design closely with real-world scenarios.

Let's discuss each component, explaining how the **Layered Architecture** and **OOP design** shape their implementation.
