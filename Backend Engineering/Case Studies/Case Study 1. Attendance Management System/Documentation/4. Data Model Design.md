### In-Memory Class Storage

We can use a **`HashMap`** to provide an in-memory solution for storing classes, as it offers efficient key-based access and retrieval, making it well-suited for quick lookups. However, in a multi-user environment where <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">multiple teachers may simultaneously add classes</span>, concurrency issues like data inconsistency, lost updates, and race conditions can arise if a regular **`HashMap`** is used.

To handle this, we can use a **`ConcurrentHashMap`** to store the classes.

```
private final Map<String, Class> classMap = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
```

The `classMap` maps each **`classId`** (String) to its corresponding **`Class`** entity, forming the backbone of our in-memory class registry.
