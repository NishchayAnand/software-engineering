### In-Memory Class Registry

We can use a **`HashMap`** to provide an in-memory solution for storing classes, as it offers efficient key-based access and retrieval, making it well-suited for quick lookups. However, in a multi-user environment where <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">multiple teachers may simultaneously add classes</span>, concurrency issues like data inconsistency, lost updates, and race conditions can arise if a regular **`HashMap`** is used.

To handle this, we can use a **`ConcurrentHashMap`** to store the classes.

```
private final Map<String, Class> classMap = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
```

The `classMap` maps each **`classId`** (String) to its corresponding **`Class`** entity, forming the backbone of our in-memory class registry.

### Class Entity



> **NOTE:** It’s more efficient to store attendance records as a `Map<EnrollmentId, Status>` rather than a `List<AttendanceRecord>`. Using a map allows constant-time lookups, prevents duplicate entries for the same student on the same date, and simplifies updates by replacing the value for a given key directly. In contrast, a list would require iterating through all records to find a student, making lookups slower and updates less straightforward. A list is preferable only if maintaining order or allowing multiple entries per student per date is necessary, which is uncommon in typical attendance systems.
