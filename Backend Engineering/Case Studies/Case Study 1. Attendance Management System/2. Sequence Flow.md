The **teacher (main actor)** is responsible for performing all **key actions (use cases)** such as **defining classes**, **adding students**, **marking attendance**, and **generating monthly reports**.

Let’s understand the **step-by-step sequence flow** of each use case to gain deeper insights into **how teachers interact with the system, how data flows during runtime, and how each feature functions within a memory-only environment**.

### Use Case 1: Create Class

A **`Teacher`** selects the **"Create New Class"** option on the UI, enters **`Class`** details like **`className`** and **`TeacherName`**, and submits the form. The frontend sends a **`POST /createClass`** request to the **`AttendanceManagementSystem`**.

The **`AttendanceManagementSystem`** intercepts the request and delegates it to the **`createClass()`** method of the **`ClassService`**. The **`createClass()`** method validates the input, creates a new **`Class`** object and stores it in-memory via **`ClassRepository`**.

### Use Case 2: Add Student

1. **Teacher** adds student to existing class
2. **ClassService** validates input and retrieves the class from repository
3. Creates new Student object with generated ID
4. Adds student to class and saves updated class
5. Returns success status
