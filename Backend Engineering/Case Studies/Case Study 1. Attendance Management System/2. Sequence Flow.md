The **teacher (main actor)** is responsible for performing all **key actions (use cases)** such as **defining classes**, **adding students**, **marking attendance**, and **generating monthly reports**.

Let’s understand the **step-by-step sequence flow** of each use case to gain deeper insights into **how teachers interact with the system, how data flows during runtime, and how each feature functions within a memory-only environment**.

### Use Case 1: Create Class

**Teacher** initiates class creation by calling `createClass()`
1. **AttendanceManagementSystem** delegates to **ClassService**
2. **ClassService** validates input, generates unique class ID, creates SchoolClass object
3. **ClassService** saves the class via **ClassRepository**
4. Success confirmation flows back through the layers

---
### Use Case 2: Add Student

1. **Teacher** adds student to existing class
2. **ClassService** validates input and retrieves the class from repository
3. Creates new Student object with generated ID
4. Adds student to class and saves updated class
5. Returns success status
