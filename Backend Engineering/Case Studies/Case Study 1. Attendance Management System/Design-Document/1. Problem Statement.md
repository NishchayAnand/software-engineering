Many schools still rely on manual methods such as **paper registers** or **spreadsheets** to track student attendance. While simple, these approaches are **error-prone**, **time-consuming**, and make it difficult to **aggregate data**, **generate reports**, or **identify attendance trends** over time.

In most cases, **teachers bear the operational burden** of marking attendance daily, calculating attendance summaries manually, and submitting reports to administrators. These inefficiencies can lead to delayed interventions for students with chronic absenteeism, poor record-keeping, and administrative overhead.

To address these limitations, we aim to design a **School Attendance Management System** that enables **teachers to mark student attendance** and **generate attendance reports** for their assigned classes.

### Functional Requirements

Design the backend infrastructure for a **locally networked, in-memory Attendance Management System** that enables **teachers** to:

1. **Create classes and register students** at the beginning of each session.
2. **Record daily attendance** for every student in their respective classes.
3. **Generate** and **view attendance reports** for any selected class.
