The **Attendance Management System (AMS) API** is designed using a **Layered Architecture**. This approach organizes the system into distinct layers, allowing each layer to focus on a single responsibility.

We can leverage **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** to model real-world entities such as **`Teacher`**, **`Class`**, and **`Student`** as objects, encapsulating both their data and behaviors. This makes the system more intuitive by aligning the software design closely with real-world scenarios.

Let's discuss each use case, explaining how the **Layered Architecture** and **OOP design** shape the implementation.
