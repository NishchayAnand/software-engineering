The Hotel Reservation System APIs are structured into four primary resource groups, each addressing a core aspect of the system: **User API**, **Hotel API**, **Inventory API**, and **Pricing API**.

Let’s discuss each in detail, outlining their endpoints, request formats, business logic, response structures and traffic to handle under normal and peak load conditions.

### User API

handle sign up requests

<span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold">Sample Request Body</span>

<span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold">Business Logic</span>

<span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold">Sample Response Body</span>

<span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold">Load Estimation</span>

```
- Assumption: Daily Active Users (DAU) = 5 Million
- Assumption: 20% of DAU log in per day

- Total Requests per Day = 5M * 20% = 1M
- Average RPS = 1,000,000 / (24 * 60 * 60) ≈ 10 RPS

- Assumption: Peak Load Factor = 5x
- Peak RPS = 10 * 5 ≈ 50 RPS
```

> Design Choice: Keep IAM API (for sign in and api requests) separate from User API

### Inventory Service

Search Hotels

<span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold">Sample Response Body</span>

<span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold">Load Estimation</span>

```
- Assumption: Average Search Requests per User per Day = 5

- Total Requests per Day = 5M * 5 = 25M
- Average RPS = 25,000,000 / (86,400) ≈ 250 RPS

- Assumption: Peak Load Factor = 5x
- Peak RPS = 250 * 5 ≈ 1,250 RPS
```

### Hotel Service

```
- Assumption: 50% of users view details after search
- Assumption: Average View Details Requests per User per Day = 2

- Total Requests per Day = 5M * 50% * 2 = 5,000,000
- Average RPS = 5,000,000 / (86,400) ≈ 50 RPS

- Assumption: Peak Load Factor = 5x
- Peak RPS = 50 * 5 ≈ 250 RPS

- Assumption: Peak Load Factor = 5x
- Peak RPS = 1 * 5 = 5 RPS
