### Storage Estimation

Designing a scalable system requires a clear understanding of how much data the platform needs to store and manage over time. **Storage estimation** helps us anticipate database size, plan for indexing, implement backup strategies, and decide whether to adopt **sharding or archiving** for future growth. 

Let's estimate the storage requirements for key entities:

<span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold">Users</span>

This entity forms the basis for identity management, personalization, and secure access across the platform.

```
- User ID: ~16 bytes (UUID or numeric ID)
- Name: ~100 bytes (First Name + Last Name)
- Email: ~100 bytes (can be long, e.g., corporate emails)
- Phone Number: ~20 bytes (include country code + separators)
- Hashed Password: ~256 bytes (depending on algorithm)
- Other Attributes: ~500 bytes (profile image URL, addresses, preferences, etc.)
```

```
- (Assumption) Total Registered Users: 50 Million
- Average User Record Size: 1 KB (with indexes & overhead)
- Total Storage = 50,000,000 * 1 KB = 50,000,000 KB = 50 GB
```

<span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold">Hotel</span>

The **Hotel entity** serves as the foundation for the booking platform, providing the details users need to discover and evaluate hotels before making a reservation. It would contain metadata such as:

```
- Hotel ID: ~16 bytes (UUID or numeric ID)
- Name: ~100 bytes (typically under 50 characters)
- Location: ~250 bytes (full address, city, state, country)  
- Description: ~2 KB (maximum 2,000 characters)
- Amenities: ~500 bytes (list of 10 amenities, e.g., “Wi-Fi, Pool”)
- Images Metadata: ~2 KB (10 image URLs, each ~200 bytes)
```

Based on these field-level estimates, we can now approximate the overall storage required for hotels:

```
- Assumption: Total Hotels = 1 Million
- Average Hotel Record Size = 5 KB (with indexes & overhead)
- Total Storage for Hotels = 1,000,000 × 5 KB = 5 GB
```

> **NOTE:** Assuming each hotel has **10 images** and each image is around **500 KB**, the total storage required for storing all images would be: `1,000,000 × 10 × 500 KB = 5,000,000,000 KB = 5 TB`.

<span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold">Room</span>

If rooms were stored as an **embedded list inside the Hotel entity**, updating a single room (e.g., changing its availability or price) would require **updating the entire hotel record**. This could lead to **write conflicts** and require **locking the whole hotel record**, reducing performance under high load. 

By keeping **Room** as a separate entity, each room can be updated independently, minimising lock contention and improving **scalability**, **performance**, and **concurrency handling**.

```
- Room ID: ~16 bytes (UUID or numeric ID)
- Room Type: ~100 bytes (e.g., "Deluxe", "Standard")  
- Price: ~50 bytes (price value + currency)  
- Availability: ~250 bytes (calendar)  
- Other Attributes: ~500 bytes (bed type, occupancy, amenties, etc.)
```

```
- Assumption: Average Rooms per Hotel = 100
- Average Room Record Size = 1 KB (with indexes & overhead)  
- Total Storage for Rooms = 1,000,000 * 100 * 1 KB = 100 GB
```

<span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold">Booking</span>

This entity represents the transactional data that links a user to a specific room in a hotel for a defined date range.

```
- User ID: ~16 bytes (UUID or numeric ID)
- Hotel ID: ~16 bytes
- Room ID: ~16 bytes
- Dates: ~32 bytes (check-in and check-out dates)
- Payment status: ~20 bytes (e.g., “Paid”, “Pending”)
- Other Attributes: ~500 bytes (created timestamp, updated timestamp, etc.)
```

Since booking records are transactional in nature, they are most frequently queried within the first **12 months** (for cancellations, modifications, customer support, disputes, etc.). After this retention window, the likelihood of accessing historical bookings drops significantly.

```
- Assumption: Daily Bookings = 100,000 (from load estimation)
- Assumption: Booking Retention = 1 year (365 days)
- Total Bookings per Year = 100,000 * 365 = 36.5 Million
- Booking Record Size = 1 KB (with indexes & overhead)
- Total Storage for Bookings = 36,500,000 * 1 KB = 36.5 GB
```

> **NOTE:** To optimize performance and reduce storage costs, move older bookings from the **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) database** to an **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) database**.
