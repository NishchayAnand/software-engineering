### Use Case 1: Pay In

**Order is an important step in the payment process.**

- An order should be created for every payment.
- You can create an order using the [Orders API](https://razorpay.com/docs/payments/payment-gateway/web-integration/standard/integration-steps#api-sample-code). It is a server-side API call.

The `order_id` received in the response should be passed to the checkout. This ties the order with the payment and secures the request from being tampered.'

> **NOTE:** Payments made without an `order_id` cannot be captured and will be automatically refunded. You must create an order before initiating payments to ensure proper payment processing.
