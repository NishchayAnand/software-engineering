With multithreading, multiple threads can execute different sections of the program. However, all threads share the same heap memory, meaning they can access the same objects.

While each thread runs in its own call stack, they can still interact with shared data. This creates a critical risk: **multiple threads accessing and modifying a single shared object simultaneously**. For example, <span style="color:green;">if two threads call setters on the same object without coordination, the data can become inconsistent or corrupted.</span>

### What is a Race Condition?

A **race condition** arises when two or more threads access shared data **at the same time**, and at least one of the threads **modifies** that data.

The key problem is that the **outcome of operations depends on the unpredictable timing** and interleaving of thread execution. In other words, <span style="color:green;">the program's behaviour is no longer deterministic, it may produce different results on different runs, even if the input remains the same.</span>

Race conditions typically occur during a sequence of operations that should be atomic (executed as a single, uninterruptible unit), but in reality, they’re executed separately. This separation allows **other threads to interfere between those steps**, potentially leading to unexpected or incorrect results.

**Example**

It is entirely possible that the current thread will be deactivated between the successful outcome of the test and the call to transfer.

```
if (bank.getBalance(from) >= amount) {
	// thread might be deactivated at this point
	balance -= amount;
}
```

By the time the thread is running again, the account balance may have fallen below the withdrawal amount. <span style="color:green;">You must make sure that the thread cannot be interrupted between the test and the insertion.</span>

> **NOTE:** Race conditions may not manifest during development or testing, especially if the system has low load or few threads. However, under production conditions, i.e., with more threads, higher CPU load, or different timing, they can suddenly surface, causing **data corruption**, **incorrect program logic**, or **application crashes**.

### Real-World Example: ATM Withdrawal

Two people (Alice and Bob) try to <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">withdraw</span> `₹5,000` each from the same <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">bank account</span> with `₹10,000`. Both ATMs <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">check the balance</span> at the same time, see enough funds, and proceed to <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">withdraw</span>. 

```
class BankAccount {
    private int balance = 10000;

    public void withdraw(int amount) {
	    String accountHolder = Thread.currentThread().getName();
        if (balance >= amount) {
            System.out.println(accountHolder + " about to withdraw ₹" + amount);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(100); // Simulate delay
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            balance -= amount;
            System.out.println(accountHolder + " completed withdrawal. Remaining                                balance: ₹" + balance);
        } else {
            System.out.println(accountHolder + " tried to withdraw but                                          insufficient balance!");
        }
    }

    public int getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}
```

```
public class RaceConditionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount();

        // Create two threads simulating Alice and Bob
        Thread alice = new Thread(() -> account.withdraw(5000), "Alice");
        Thread bob = new Thread(() -> account.withdraw(5000), "Bob");

        alice.start();
        bob.start();
    }
}
```

<span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">Sample Output</span>
	
```
Alice is about to withdraw ₹5000
bob is about to withdraw ₹5000
bob completed withdrawal. Remaining balance: ₹5000
Alice completed withdrawal. Remaining balance: ₹5000
```

<span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">Explanation</span>

Because **memory updates take time** and the **operations (check, deduct, update)** aren’t atomic, both transactions use the same initial balance. This results in an incorrect final balance of ₹`5,000` instead of `₹0` (one deduction is lost).

> <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">This illustrates a race condition, where multiple threads (or users) access and modify shared data without proper coordination, leading to inconsistent or wrong results.</span>

### How to Handle Race Conditions?

To prevent race conditions, developers must **coordinate access to shared resources**. This is typically done by:

- **Synchronization** (e.g., `synchronized` blocks or locks) to ensure that only one thread accesses critical sections at a time.
- **Immutable objects**, which eliminate the risk by ensuring shared data can't be modified after creation.

Both approaches ensure thread-safe operations and preserve data integrity.
