Spring Cloud is a set of tools and frameworks built on top of the Spring ecosystem (mainly Spring Boot) that helps developers build and manage distributed systems and microservices.

When you move from a monolithic architecture to microservices, you face challenges such as:

- Service discovery (how services find each other dynamically)
- Configuration management (keeping configs consistent across services)
- Load balancing
- Circuit breakers & fault tolerance (handling failures gracefully)
- Distributed tracing (tracking requests across multiple services)
- Centralized logging  

Spring Cloud provides ready-to-use patterns and integrations to solve these problems, so you donâ€™t need to reinvent the wheel.
