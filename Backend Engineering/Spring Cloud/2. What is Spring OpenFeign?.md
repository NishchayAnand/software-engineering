`Feign` is a declarative `REST` client. This means that instead of writing a lot of boilerplate code (like using `RestTemplate` or `WebClient`), you simply define a `Java` interface, and `Feign` automatically generates the `HTTP` calls for you.

**Spring Cloud OpenFeign** integrates `Feign` with the `Spring` ecosystem, making it super easy to call other microservices in your system.

### How it Works?

Normally, if Service A needs to call Service Bâ€™s REST API, you would:

- Write code with RestTemplate or WebClient
- Handle serialization/deserialization manually
- Manage URLs, headers, etc.

With **OpenFeign**, you just define an interface like this:

```
@FeignClient(name = "inventory-service", url = "http://inventory-service")
public interface InventoryClient {

    @GetMapping("/inventory/{hotelId}")
    InventoryResponse getInventory(@PathVariable("hotelId") String hotelId);
}
```

Now in your service, you can inject and use it just like a normal Spring bean:

```
@Service
public class HotelService {
    
    private final InventoryClient inventoryClient;

    public HotelService(InventoryClient inventoryClient) {
        this.inventoryClient = inventoryClient;
    }

    public InventoryResponse fetchInventory(String hotelId) {
	    // Feign makes the REST call automatically
        return inventoryClient.getInventory(hotelId);
    }
}
```
