The **`@Controller`** annotation is a specialized form of `Component` annotation, provided by **Spring MVC** to define classes that can handle **HTTP requests**.

Methods in a controller class typically handle the request logic, retrieve data, and then return a response to the client.

> **NOTE:** By default, methods in a controller class return a logical view name, which is resolved to an actual view (like a **JSP** or **HTML** page) by a `ViewResolver`.
