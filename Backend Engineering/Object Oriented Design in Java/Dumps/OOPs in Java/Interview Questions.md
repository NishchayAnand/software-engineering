# OOP Interview Questions

**Q. What is the difference between `Abtraction` and `Encapsulation`?**

- `Encapsulation` is all about **bundling data and the methods** that operate on that data together **into a single unit**. Encapsulation helps **shield the internal data (properties)** of an object from direct external access.

- `Abstraction` states that the **external behavior (interface)** of an object **should be kept separate from the implementation details** of how that behavior is achieved. It gives us the **freedom to modify the internal workings** of an object without impacting any code using that object.

- Encapsulation **"protects what's inside"** of an object (data), whereas, Abstraction focuses on **"how to use"** that object (functionalities).
