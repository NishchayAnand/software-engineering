# Understanding Abstraction

Abstraction states that the external behavior **(interface)** of an object should be kept separate from the implementation details of how that behavior is achieved. It gives us the freedom to modify the internal workings of an object without impacting any code using that object.

> Encapsulation protects "what's inside" of an object (data), whereas, Abstraction focuses on "how to use" that object (functionalities).
