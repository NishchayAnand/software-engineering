# Understanding Factory Method Pattern

The Factory Method pattern suggests that you replace direct object construction calls (using the new operator) with calls to a special factory method.

> **NOTE:** The objects are still created via the new operator, but itâ€™s being called from within the factory method. Objects returned by a factory method are often referred to as products.

You can override the factory method in a subclass and change the class of products being created by the method.
