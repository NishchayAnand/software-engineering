- If the thing creating objects is a method, it's known as a **factory method**. 
- If the thing creating objects is also an object, it's known as an **abstract factory**. These are useful when you want to separate construction of objects into a completely separate Java interface.

### Scaling Factory With Abstract Factory



If this creation logic is implemented as a **method** within a class, it's called a **Factory Method**. The **Factory Method Pattern** allows subclasses to override this method to determine which specific object to instantiate — making it useful when different classes in a hierarchy are responsible for creating different kinds of objects.

On the other hand, when the object creation responsibility is moved into a separate **factory object**, we call it an **Abstract Factory**. The **Abstract Factory Pattern** defines an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. This pattern is ideal when your system needs to produce a variety of related objects (for example, UI components like buttons, checkboxes, and menus that must all follow a certain style or theme). With an abstract factory, you encapsulate these creation methods inside a factory class, providing a clear separation of concerns and promoting modular, maintainable code.

In short, **Factory Method** is a single method that subclasses can customize, while **Abstract Factory** is a complete factory object offering multiple factory methods to create related objects. Both patterns help manage object creation but are applied based on the scope and complexity of the creation logic you want to abstract.

For example, if creating an object involves setting multiple properties, handling dependencies, or choosing between several subclasses, a factory can manage all of this behind the scenes. 

The client simply calls the factory to get the object it needs, without worrying about the "how" of its creation. This not only promotes **loose coupling** but also adheres to the **Single Responsibility Principle**, as object creation logic is separated from business logic.

### EXTRA

Code that instantiates concrete classes is an area of frequent change. We know it's always better to encapsulate code that varies. Instantiation is an activity that shouldn't always be done in public and can often lead to coupling problems.

We aren't supposed to program to an implementation, but every time we use the **new** operator, we are certainly instantiating a concrete class which is definitely an implementation and not an interface.

If your code is written to an interface, then it will work with any new class implementing that interface (through polymorphism). However, when you have code that makes use of lots of concrete classes, the code may have to be changed as new concrete classes are added. To extend your code with new concrete types, you'll have to reopen it for modification, violating the **open-close principle.**

## Advantages of Factory Pattern

By placing all the creation code in object or method, we can avoid duplication in our code and provide one place to perform maintenance. That also means **clients depend only upon interfaces rather than the concrete classes required to instantiate objects.** This allows us to program to an interface, not an implementation.

**Q. Difference between Simple Factory Pattern and Factory Method Pattern.**

In Simple Factory Pattern, the factory object is responsible for object creation.

In Factory Method Pattern, the factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses. With factory method, the creator is not tightly coupled to any concrete product.

In simple words, the Simple Factory Pattern centralizes object creation in a single factory class, while the Factory Method Pattern decentralizes it by delegating object creation to subclasses, providing more flexibility and adherence to object-oriented design principles.

---

**Q. Difference between Factory Method Pattern and Abstract Factory Pattern.**

Both abstract factory and factory method create objects. But abstract factory does that through object composition and factory method does that through inheritance.

To create objects using Factory Method, you need extend a class and provide an implementation for a factory method.

It simply calls the factory to get the object it needs, without worrying about the **"how"** of its creation.
