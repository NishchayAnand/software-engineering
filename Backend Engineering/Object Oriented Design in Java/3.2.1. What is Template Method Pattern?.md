A bad software design often contains code duplication, inconsistent workflows, and scattered logic, making the system harder to maintain, prone to bugs, and resistant to change.

**Example**

```
public class CreditCardPaymentProcessor {

	public void validatePaymentDetails() {
		System.out.println("Validating credit card...");
	}

    public void executePayment(double amount) {
	    System.out.println("Paid $" + amount + " using Credit Card");
    }

    public void sendReceipt() {
        System.out.println("Receipt sent to customer.");
    }
	
}
```

```
public class PayPalPaymentProcessor {

	public void validatePaymentDetails() {
		System.out.println("Validating PayPal...");
	}

    public void executePayment(double amount) {
	    System.out.println("Paid $" + amount + " using PayPal");
    }

    public void sendReceipt() {
        System.out.println("Receipt sent to customer.");
    }
	
}
```

```
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CreditCardPaymentProcessor ccProcessor = new                                                                                CreditCardPaymentProcessor();
        ccProcessor.validatePaymentDetails();
        ccProcessor.executePayment(100);
        ccProcessor.sendReceipt();  // Correct flow

        PayPalPaymentProcessor ppProcessor = new PayPalPaymentProcessor();
        ppProcessor.executePayment(200);
        ppProcessor.sendReceipt();
        // Oops! Forgot to call validatePaymentDetails() for PayPal!
    }
}
``` 

Both `CreditCardPaymentProcessor` and `PayPalPaymentProcessor` repeat the same `sendReceipt()` method. This violates the **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)** principle 

Additionally, because the `Client` manages the sequence of operations, there’s no centralized enforcement of the correct payment processing workflow, which can easily result in errors if a step is missed or altered.

### Good Design: Keep Common Logic in One Place

Placing shared logic in a single location allows you to ensure that any change affects all dependent code, making maintenance easier, reducing bugs, and keeping the system consistent.

The **Template Method Pattern** enforces you move the **common steps** into an **abstract base class** and define a **template method** that enforces the sequence of steps.

The intent of this **template method** is to implement an algorithm, leaving the definition of some operations or steps to a concrete subclass. Each subclass must provide its own implementation for the undefined steps, ensuring that while the overall process remains consistent, specific behaviors can vary as needed.

> **NOTE:** The **Template Method Pattern** hides away all boilerplate code and allows the developer to concentrate solely on business logic.

### How to Apply Template Method Pattern?

The Template Method pattern suggests that you break down an algorithm into a series of steps, turn these steps into methods, and put a series of calls to these methods inside a single template method.

The steps may either be `abstract`, or have some default implementation. To use the algorithm, the client is supposed to provide its own subclass, implement all abstract steps, and override some of the optional ones if needed.

The template method is usually declared `final` to prevent subclasses from reworking the sequence of steps in the algorithm.

**Example**

```
abstract class PaymentProcessor {

    // Template Method - defines the sequence
    public final void processPayment(double amount) {
        validatePaymentDetails();
        executePayment(amount);
        sendReceipt();  // Common logic
    }

    // Steps to be implemented by subclasses
    protected abstract void validatePaymentDetails();
    protected abstract void executePayment(double amount);

    // Common step shared by all subclasses
    private void sendReceipt() {
        System.out.println("Receipt sent to customer.");
    }
}
```

```
class CreditCardPaymentProcessor extends PaymentProcessor {
    @Override
    protected void validatePaymentDetails() {
        System.out.println("Validating credit card details...");
    }

    @Override
    protected void executePayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing credit card payment of $" + amount);
    }
}

class PayPalPaymentProcessor extends PaymentProcessor {
    @Override
    protected void validatePaymentDetails() {
        System.out.println("Validating PayPal account...");
    }

    @Override
    protected void executePayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing PayPal payment of $" + amount);
    }
}
```

```
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PaymentProcessor creditCardProcessor = new CreditCardPaymentProcessor();
        creditCardProcessor.processPayment(150);

        PaymentProcessor payPalProcessor = new PayPalPaymentProcessor();
        payPalProcessor.processPayment(250);
    }
}
```

### Limitations of Template Method Pattern

While the **Template Method Pattern** enforces a consistent workflow and promotes reuse, it **tends to make client code tightly coupled to concrete subclasses**. 

This happens because the client must explicitly choose and instantiate a specific subclass in order to use the algorithm. As a result, if new subclasses are added or existing ones change, the client code may require modification, violating the **Open-Closed Principle**. 

This tight coupling can reduce flexibility, especially in large systems where switching behaviors dynamically at runtime is required.

> **NOTE:** Despite the trade-off of tight coupling, the **Template Method Pattern** is popular in frameworks because **the framework itself acts as the client, not your application code (Inversion of Control)**.
