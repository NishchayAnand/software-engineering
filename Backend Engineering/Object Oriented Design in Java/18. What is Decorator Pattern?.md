In object-oriented design, you often need to extend the behavior of objects at runtime. 

**Example**

Your application uses a `PaymentGateway` interface:

```
public interface PaymentGateway {
    void pay(double amount);
}
```

You have a basic implementation:

```
public class StripePayment implements PaymentGateway {
    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid $" + amount + " using Stripe Payment Gateway");
    }
}
```

A common new requirement could be to extend the `PaymentGateway` to **account for discounts (behaviour)** that may be applied to the user at runtime.

### Bad Design: Extending Behaviour using Inheritance

A naive solution to extend behavior without modifying the existing code is to create **a new subclass for each variation** of that behavior.

Example

```
// Adds discount
public class DiscountedStripePayment extends StripePayment {
    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        double discountedAmount = amount - (amount * 0.10);  // 10% discount
        System.out.println("[DISCOUNT] Discount applied. Final amount: $" +                                  discountedAmount);
        super.pay(discountedAmount);
    }
}
```

However, using inheritance can often lead to **hierarchical complexity and a rigid class structure**, where introducing new behaviors or their combinations causes a rapid increase in the number of subclasses. This makes the code harder to maintain, scale, and understand over time.

Instead of modifying existing classes or creating complex subclass hierarchies, we can use the **Decorator Pattern** to wrap objects with new functionality in a flexible and modular way.

### How to Apply Decorator Pattern?

To apply the **Decorator Pattern**, create a <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">base decorator class that holds a reference to the object it decorates (composition) and forwards method calls to it (delegation).</span>

The **base decorator** serves as the foundation for all concrete decorators. Concrete decorators inherit from this base class and override methods to add extra behavior either before or after delegating the call to the wrapped object. 

By composing objects this way, you can build a **chain of decorators** that dynamically add different behaviors to the same object at runtime, promoting flexibility and eliminating the need for rigid subclass hierarchies.

**Example**

```
// Base Decorator
public class PaymentGatewayDecorator implements PaymentGateway {

    protected PaymentGateway paymentGateway; // Composition

    public PaymentGatewayDecorator(PaymentGateway paymentGateway) {
        this.paymentGateway = paymentGateway;
    }

    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        paymentGateway.pay(amount); // Delegation
    }
    
}
```

```
public class DiscountDecorator extends PaymentGatewayDecorator {
    
    private double discountRate;  // e.g., 0.10 for 10%

    public DiscountDecorator(PaymentGateway paymentGateway, double discountRate) {
        super(paymentGateway);
        this.discountRate = discountRate;
    }

    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        double discountedAmount = amount - (amount * discountRate);
        System.out.println("[DISCOUNT] Applied " + (discountRate * 100) + "%                                  discount. Final amount: $" + discountedAmount);
        super.pay(discountedAmount);
    }
    
}
```

```
public class PaymentClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PaymentGateway stripePayment = new StripePayment();
        PaymentGateway decoratedPayment = new LoggingDecorator(new                                                      DiscountDecorator(stripePayment, 0.10));
        decoratedPayment.pay(300.0);     
    }  
}
```

> **NOTE:** A key rule in the **Decorator Pattern** is that decorators must implement the **same interface or abstract class** as the object they decorate. This ensures that the decorated object can be used **interchangeably** with the original object in the client code.

---
### Limitations of Decorator Pattern

Designs based on the **Decorator Pattern** often lead to a large number of small, specialized classes, each responsible for adding a specific behavior. 

While this promotes modularity and flexibility, it can also make the system harder to navigate for developers, especially when they need to understand or configure multiple decorators stacked together. Managing the order of decorators and knowing which combination to apply may become overwhelming, increasing the learning curve and potential for misuse. 

This trade-off is a common consideration when choosing the **Decorator Pattern** for extending behavior in complex systems.
