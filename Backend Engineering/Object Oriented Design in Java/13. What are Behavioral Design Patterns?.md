Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.


Behavioral patterns include any design patterns that involve how different objects interact with each other. If that definition sounds really vague, it's because it is a really broad category. 

Even so, recognizing different behavioral patterns can help you when you're designing your own software to decide which objects should be responsible for what and how to organize the code in a clear way.
