**SOLID** provides a philosophical and practical lens to build a well-designed software, especially in object-oriented programming.

- **S – Single Responsibility** → promotes cohesion.
- **O – Open/Closed** → encourages extension without fragile rewrites.
- **L – Liskov Substitution** → maintains predictable behaviour in polymorphic code.
- **I – Interface Segregation** → keeps interfaces clean and focused.
- **D – Dependency Inversion** → enforces low coupling and better testability.

> **NOTE:** **SOLID** doesn’t give you the design, but it helps you evaluate whether your design is **robust, clean, and adaptable**.
