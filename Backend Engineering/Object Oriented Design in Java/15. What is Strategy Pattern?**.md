When you mix **changing behavior** and **stable behavior** inside the same class, that class becomes rigid and harder to maintain.

**Example**

```
public class PaymentGateway {

    public void processPayment(String paymentMethod, double amount) {
    
        if (paymentMethod.equals("creditcard")) {
            System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using Credit Card");
        } else if (paymentMethod.equals("paypal")) {
            System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using PayPal");
        } else if (paymentMethod.equals("upi")) {
            System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using UPI");
        } else {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unsupported payment type");
        }
        
    }
    
}
```

```
public class Client {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

		PaymentGateway gateway = new PaymentGateway();

		// Could come from user input or config
        String paymentMethod = "creditcard"; 
		gateway.processPayment(paymentMethod, 500);
    
    }
}
```

In the `PaymentGateway` class, the logic for **how payments are processed (changing behavior)** can evolve over time. However, general action of **processing a payment (stable behavior)** remains the same.

By mixing these concerns, the `PaymentGateway` class is violating two fundamental software design principles:

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: It takes on multiple responsibilities within the same class. First, it is responsible for **processing the payment**, which should be its primary task. Second, it handles the logic for **deciding which payment method to use** by checking the type of payment within conditional statements. Third, it directly contains the **execution logic for each payment method**, embedding the specific steps required to perform each type of payment.

- **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**: Every time a new payment method is introduced, you must modify the existing class, which increases the risk of breaking existing functionality.

> **NOTE:** Identify **stable behavior** as **"what always happens"** in your business process, and **changing behavior** as **"how it happens"** that may differ or grow over time.

### Good Design: Separate Changing Behavior from Stable Behavior

**Separating concerns** keeps classes focused on a single responsibility, making the system easier to understand, test, maintain, and extend. 

Developers often try to achieve **separation of concerns** by creating subclasses.

**Example**

```
public class PaymentGateway {
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing payment of " + amount);
    }
}
```

```
public class CreditCardPaymentProcessor extends PaymentGateway {
    @Override
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using Credit Card");
    }
}

public class PayPalPaymentProcessor extends PaymentGateway {
    @Override
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using PayPal");
    }
}

public class UpiPaymentProcessor extends PaymentGateway {
    @Override
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using UPI");
    }
}
```

```
public class Client {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        PaymentGateway gateway;

		// Could come from user input or config
        String paymentMethod = "creditcard";  

        if (paymentMethod.equals("creditcard")) {
            gateway = new CreditCardPaymentProcessor();
        } else if (paymentType.equals("paypal")) {
            gateway = new PayPalPaymentProcessor();
        } else if (paymentType.equals("upi")) {
            gateway = new UpiPaymentProcessor();
        } else {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unsupported payment type");
        }

        gateway.processPayment(500);
        
    }
}
```

However, using **inheritance** tends to make client code tightly coupled to concrete subclasses because the client must explicitly create instances of specific subclasses. This tight coupling means that any change in subclass types or the addition of new types may force changes in the client code, again violating key design principles like **Open-Closed Principle** and **Dependency Inversion Principle**.

The **Strategy Pattern** solves this by allowing you to **encapsulate varying behavior inside separate strategy classes** and delegate the behavior execution at runtime. 

---
### How to Apply Strategy Pattern?

To apply the **Strategy Pattern**, extract the changing behavior into a common interface, implement different strategies for each variant, and delegate execution to the strategy via the main class (context).

**Example**

In the `PaymentGateway` class, the <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">way payments are processed differs by payment method</span>, so you can define a `PaymentStrategy` interface with a common `pay()` method. This allows each payment method to implement its specific logic separately.

```
public interface PaymentStrategy {
    void pay(double amount);
}
```

```
public class CreditCardPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using Credit Card");
    }
}

public class PayPalPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using PayPal");
    }
}
```

Refactor the `PaymentGateway` class to **delegate payment execution** to the `PaymentStrategy` interface, adhering to the **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**. This decouples the **stable behavior (processing the payment)** from the **changing behavior (how the payment is made)**, making the system more flexible, extensible, and maintainable.

```
public class PaymentGateway {

    private final PaymentStrategy paymentStrategy;

    public PaymentProcessor(PaymentStrategy paymentStrategy) {
        this.paymentStrategy = paymentStrategy;
    }

	public void setStrategy(PaymentStrategy paymentStrategy) {
        this.paymentStrategy = paymentStrategy;
    }

    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        paymentStrategy.pay(amount);
    }

}
```

```
public class Client {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

		// Initially set the payment method to Credit Card
		PaymentGateway gateway = new PaymentGateway(new CreditCardPayment());
		gateway.processPayment(500); // Paid $500 using Credit Card  

		// Later, user changes the payment method to PayPal at runtime
		gateway.setStrategy(new PayPalPayment());
		gateway.processPayment(300);   // Paid $300 using PayPal
    
    }
}
```

Instead of the client hardcoding which subclass to use, it now depends on the `PaymentStrategy` interface, promoting loose coupling and making it easier to extend or modify behaviors **without creating a new `PayementGateway` object**.
