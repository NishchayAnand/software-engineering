The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">"A class should have only one reason to change"</span>. This means each class should be designed to handle a specific set of functionalities that are closely related.

> **NOTE:** Remember **Single Responsibility Principle** as <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">"one class, one responsibility"</span>.

SRP promotes high `cohesion` within a class. This means all the methods and properties within a class should work together towards its single responsibility. Methods that seem out of place might indicate a violation of SRP.

> **NOTE:** Remember Cohesion as <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">"degree of interdependence of elements within a class"</span>.

**Identifying different responsibilities** in a class is a crucial step in applying the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). Here's how you can approach it:

- **Analyze Class Behaviour:** Start by examining the methods provided by the class. What kind of actions do they perform? Are they all related to a single concept or functionality?

- **Break Down Functionality:** Categorize the methods based on the tasks they accomplish. Look for natural groupings that represent distinct functionalities.

- **Identify the <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">"Why"</span> Behind Changes:** Consider why the class might need to change in the future. If a single class change could be triggered by multiple reasons, it might have multiple responsibilities.

**Example 1**

Imagine a class named `Order` that handles:

- Adding or removing items from the order
- Calculating the total price (including taxes)
- Saving the order details to a database

```
public class Order {

  private List<Item> items;
  private double subtotal;
  private double taxRate;

  public Order(List<Item> items, double taxRate) {
    this.items = items;
    this.taxRate = taxRate;
  }

  public void addItem(Item item) {
    items.add(item);
    calculateSubtotal();
  }

  public void removeItem(Item item) {
    items.remove(item);
    calculateSubtotal();
  }

  public double calculateTotal() {
    return subtotal * (1 + taxRate);
  }

  private void calculateSubtotal() {
    subtotal = 0;
    for (Item item : items) {
      subtotal += item.getPrice();
    }
  }

  // Methods for saving order to database (not shown for brevity)
}
```

While these tasks seem related to `Order`, they represent different functionalities. Following SRP, you could split this into three separate classes:

- `Order` **class:** This class would focus solely on representing the order itself. It might have methods to calculate the subtotal (without tax) and add/remove items.

```
// Order class (represents the order itself)
public class Order {

  private List<Item> items;
  private double subtotal;

  public Order(List<Item> items) {
    this.items = items;
  }

  public List<Item> getItems() {
    return items;
  }

  public void addItem(Item item) {
    items.add(item);
    calculateSubtotal();
  }

  public void removeItem(Item item) {
    items.remove(item);
    calculateSubtotal();
  }

  private void calculateSubtotal() {
    subtotal = 0;
    for (Item item : items) {
      subtotal += item.getPrice();
    }
  }

  public double getSubtotal() {
    return subtotal;
  }
}
```

- `OrderCalculator` **class:** This class would take an `Order` object and calculate the total price with taxes. If we need to change how the tax is calculated, for example, incorporate different taxes based on order quantities, we only modify the OrderCalculator class.

```
// OrderCalculator class (calculates total price)
public class OrderCalculator {

  public static double calculateTotal(Order order, double taxRate) {

    return order.getSubtotal() * (1 + taxRate);
  }
}
```

- `OrderPersistence` **class:** This class would handle saving the order details to a database.

```
// OrderPersistence class (saves order to database - not shown for brevity)
```
