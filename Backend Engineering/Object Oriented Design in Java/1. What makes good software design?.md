Here are some of the key **characteristics** that define a well-designed software:

- **Modularity**: System is broken into small, independent units (modules). Each module encapsulates a specific responsibility.

- **Cohesion**: Each component or module does **one thing well**. Strong cohesion → easier to maintain and reason about.

- **Low Coupling**: Modules should be independent, with minimal interdependencies. Promotes easier changes and better testability.

- **Encapsulation**: Internal details are hidden; users interact through well-defined interfaces. Improves robustness and flexibility.

- **Scalability**: System can handle growth — more users, data, features — without breaking down.

- **Reusability**: Components can be reused in different parts of the system or in other systems.

- **Testability**: Easy to write unit and integration tests. Encourages use of mocks, stubs, and dependency injection.

- **Maintainability**: Code is easy to modify, extend, and debug. Follows consistent coding conventions and documentation.
