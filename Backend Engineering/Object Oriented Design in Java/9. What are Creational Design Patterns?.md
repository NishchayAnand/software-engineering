**Creational Design Patterns** focus on <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">how objects are created (instantiated) in a system</span>. 

Instead of instantiating objects directly using the `new` keyword, these patterns provide various mechanisms to create objects in a flexible and controlled manner. The main goal is to <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">decouple the object creation process from the business logic</span>, making the system easier to maintain, scale, and extend.

> **NOTE:** These patterns are especially useful when the object creation process is complex, involves multiple steps, or depends on specific configurations or environments.

### Common Creational Design Patterns

| **Creational Pattern** | **Solves**                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Singleton              | Global access to a single instance                |
| Factory Method         | Object creation without exposing concrete classes |
| Abstract Factory       | Creating families of related objects              |
| Builder                | Step-by-step construction of complex objects      |
| Prototype              | Cloning existing objects                          |

### Advantages

- **Flexibility:** The way you create an object might depend on the situation in your program. Creational patterns isolate this logic so you can choose how to create objects at runtime.

- **Reusability:** These patterns often encapsulate common object creation workflows, allowing you to reuse that code throughout your project.
