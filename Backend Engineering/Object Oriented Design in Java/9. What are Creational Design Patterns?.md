**Creational Design Patterns** focus on <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">how objects should be created (instantiated) in a system</span>. Instead of instantiating objects directly using the `new` keyword, these patterns provide various mechanisms to create objects in a flexible and controlled manner. 

<span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">The main goal is to abstract the instantiation process, making the system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.</span>

### Advantages

- **Flexibility:** The way you create an object might depend on the situation in your program. Creational patterns isolate this logic so you can choose how to create objects at runtime.

- **Reusability:** These patterns often encapsulate common object creation workflows, allowing you to reuse that code throughout your project.
