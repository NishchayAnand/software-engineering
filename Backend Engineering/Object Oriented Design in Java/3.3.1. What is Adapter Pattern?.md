In large systems, it's common to encounter incompatible APIs that need to work together.

**Example**

You are building a modern payment system for an online store. Your application expects all payment gateways to implement this interface:

```
public interface PaymentGateway {
    void pay(double amount);
}
```

You already have a couple of implementations:

```
public class StripePayment implements PaymentGateway {
    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid $" + amount + " using Stripe");
    }
}
```

Now your company partners with an old bank that gives you their legacy payment class:

```
public class LegacyBankPayment {
    public void makePayment(int amountInCents) {
        System.out.println("Paid $" + (amountInCents / 100.0) + " using Legacy                               Bank Payment");
    }
}
```

The `LegacyBankPayment` class provides a `makePayment()` method that accepts an amount in cents, while your application expects all payment systems to implement a `PaymentGateway` interface with a `pay()` method that accepts amounts in dollars. 

Since you cannot modify the legacy class, especially if it's part of a third-party library, you face the challenge of making it work with your existing system.

The **Adapter Pattern** solves this by acting as a bridge, allowing these systems to work together seamlessly without changing their original implementations.

### How to Apply Adapter Pattern?

To apply the **Adapter Pattern**, you wrap the incompatible interface object inside a class that implements the existing (expected) interface used by your system. 

The adapter acts as a bridge by translating the client’s requests into calls that the incompatible object understands, taking care of any required data transformations or method conversions.

**Example**

You can create a `LegacyBankPaymentAdapter` class that implements `PaymentGateway` and internally holds a reference to `LegacyBankPayment`. 

Inside the `pay()` method of the adapter, you convert the amount from dollars to cents and call `makePayment()` on the legacy class. 

```
public class LegacyBankPaymentAdapter implements PaymentGateway {
    private LegacyBankPayment legacyBankPayment;

    public LegacyBankPaymentAdapter(LegacyBankPayment legacyBankPayment) {
        this.legacyBankPayment = legacyBankPayment;
    }

    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        int amountInCents = (int) (amount * 100);
        legacyBankPayment.makePayment(amountInCents);
    }
}
```

This way, the client code continues to work with the `PaymentGateway` interface without knowing about the legacy class, achieving seamless integration without altering the existing legacy code.

```
public class Client {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Using a legacy payment system via Adapter
        PaymentGateway legacyAdapter = new LegacyBankPaymentAdapter(new                                                                    LegacyBankPayment());
        legacyAdapter.pay(250.00);
        
    }
    
}
```
