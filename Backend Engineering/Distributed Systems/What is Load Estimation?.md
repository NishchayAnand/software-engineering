Understanding **how much traffic the system will handle** is crucial for designing a scalable and resilient architecture. It allows us to size infrastructure appropriately, anticipate bottlenecks, and decide where optimizations like **caching** or **load balancing** are required.

To quantify this, estimate the <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">Requests Per Second (RPS)</span> the system must support under both normal and peak load conditions for core user interactions.

there’s a systematic way to size how many instances you need for peak.

# Step-by-step capacity recipe

1. **Pin down peak load**
    

- Peak **RPS** (or msg/s), by endpoint/type (e.g., Search, Price, Book).
    
- Target SLOs (e.g., p95 ≤ 200 ms, error rate ≤ 0.1%).
    

2. **Measure per-instance sustainable throughput**
    

- Load test a single instance on the target compute.
    
- Record the **highest RPS that still meets SLOs** at a **target utilization** (usually 60–70%).  
    Call this **Sᵢ** (RPS per instance).
    

3. **Baseline instance count**
    

N0=⌈Peak RPSSi⌉N0​=⌈Si​Peak RPS​⌉

4. **Add cushions you actually need**
    

- **Burst/uncertainty headroom (c)**: 10–30% → N1=⌈N0⋅(1+c)⌉N1​=⌈N0​⋅(1+c)⌉
    
- **Failure tolerance** (e.g., survive loss of 1 AZ out of Z):
    
    N=⌈N11−1Z⌉N=⌈1−Z1​N1​​⌉
- **Min pods per AZ**: enforce even spread and N+1 per zone.
    

5. **Check shared dependencies**
    

- Multiply per-instance downstream usage: DB QPS, cache ops, Kafka I/O.
    
- Ensure those tiers can handle N×N× load; otherwise they become the limiter (resize or add replicas).

## Worked examples

### A) Request/response (Search Service)

- Measured single-pod sustainable: **Sᵢ = 1,000 RPS @ p95 150 ms, ~65% CPU**
    
- Peak expected: **8,000 RPS**
    
- Headroom **c = 0.3** (30%), Zones **Z = 3**
    
- Baseline: N0=⌈8000/1000⌉=8N0​=⌈8000/1000⌉=8
    
- Headroom: N1=⌈8⋅1.3⌉=11N1​=⌈8⋅1.3⌉=11
    
- Lose 1 of 3 AZs: N=⌈111−13⌉=⌈16.5⌉=17N=⌈1−31​11​⌉=⌈16.5⌉=17  
    **Deploy 17 pods** (spread ~6/6/5).
    

### B) Queue/worker (Reservation jobs)

- Arrival λ = **1,200 msgs/s**, mean processing **S = 40 ms** = 0.04 s
    
- Parallel workers per instance **P = 20** (one worker ≈ one core/thread)
    
- Target utilization **u = 0.7**
    
- Per-instance service rate ≈ P/uS=20/(0.7⋅0.04)≈714 msgs/sP/uS=20/(0.7⋅0.04)≈714 msgs/s
    
- N0=⌈1200/714⌉=2N0​=⌈1200/714⌉=2 → add **30% headroom** ⇒ **3**, plus **N+1** ⇒ **4 instances**.

## Quick cheat-sheet (drop into your runbook)

- **RPS services:**  
    `instances = ceil( peak_rps / S_i )` → add headroom (10–30%) → add AZ-failure factor.
    
- **Workers/queues:**  
    `instances = ceil( λ / ( P / (u * S) ) )` where  
    λ=arrival rate, P=parallelism per instance, u=target util, S=avg processing time.
    
- **Latency budgets:** keep instance utilization ≤ ~70–75% to avoid queue blowups.
    
- **Pre-scale if ramp is steep:** if traffic can jump faster than spin-up time, schedule a pre-warm window.
