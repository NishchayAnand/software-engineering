Designing the system architecture begins with mapping the estimated load, storage, and bandwidth requirements into concrete design decisions. The goal is to build a solution that is **scalable, fault-tolerant, and efficient**, while ensuring a smooth user experience under peak demand. This involves defining the **core services** and sizing their instances, deciding how to **distribute and store data**, identifying where **caching** provides the most benefit, integrating a **CDN** to handle image-heavy traffic, and engineering the system to operate reliably in a **distributed network**. Each decision is informed by our earlier back-of-the-envelope estimations, ensuring the architecture is both **data-driven and cost-effective**.

The most important design decision for designing the microservices architecture is to figure out **where to place service boundaries**. Good boundaries follow business **bounded contexts** where each service owns a single, stable domain model and its data store, exposes a clear API, and can meet its own SLOs without reaching into another service’s tables.
