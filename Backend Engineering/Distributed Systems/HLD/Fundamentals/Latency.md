# Understanding Latency

Latency is defined as how long a system takes to transmit data from one point to another point in the system. In simpler terms, it's about getting information from A to B as quickly as possible.

**Low latency** is crucial for applications and systems that require real-time or near-real-time responses.

Latency is typically measured in milliseconds (ms) or even microseconds (Âµs) for extremely low latency systems.

> **NOTE:** The lower the latency, the better.

## What factors influence Latency?

1. Inefficient Software.
2. Processing speed of the Hardware.
3. Physical distance between two points.
4. **Network Congestion (Heavy Traffic).**

## How to achieve Low Latency?

Achieving low latency is about minimizing the time it takes for information to travel, which is critical for many modern applications and services. Few ways by which we can achieve low latency include:

1. **Poweful Hardware**, i.e., high-speed processors and storage devices.
2. **Efficient Software**, i.e., optimized algorithms and data structures.
3. **Proximity**, i.e., placing servers and data centers close to the user.
