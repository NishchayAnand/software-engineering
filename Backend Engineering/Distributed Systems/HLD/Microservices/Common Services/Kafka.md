# Understanding Kafka

An open-source distributed event streaming platform used to handle `large-scale`, `high-throughput`, and `real-time data feeds`.

## Key Concepts:

1. **Producer**: A component or service that sends data (called messages or events) to Kafka. Producers push messages to a Kafka topic.

2. **Consumer**: A consumer reads records from Kafka topics.
