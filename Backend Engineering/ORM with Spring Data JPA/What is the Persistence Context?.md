A **Persistence Context** is basically a **cache or container** where JPA keeps track of all entity objects that you’ve interacted with (created, read, updated, or deleted) during a particular transaction or session.

> **NOTE:** Think of it as the **first-level cache** that holds **managed entities**, meaning, entities that JPA is currently tracking.
