The **EntityManager** is the **interface** you use in JPA to **interact with the persistence context**. 

It’s like the **gateway** between your application and the persistence layer (database). Without it, you’d have to manually handle:

- SQL statements (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `SELECT`)
- Connection management
- Transactions
- Object-to-table mapping (converting between Java objects and database rows)

The **EntityManager** automates all of that for you.
