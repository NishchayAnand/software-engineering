# Understanding Polymorphism

Polymorphism literally translates to "having many forms." It reflects the ability of an entity to behave in more than one form.

Polymorphism in object-oriented programming exists in 2 main forms:

- `Method Overloading`: Allows us to define multiple methods within the same class with a same name but different parameter lists.

- `Method Overriding`: Allows us to define a method that can be overridden by different classes to respond differently.
