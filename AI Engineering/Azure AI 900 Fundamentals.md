Q. Explain the key principles behind Responsible AI.

1. **Fairness**: AI systems should treat all people fairly. **Azure Machine Learning includes the capability to interpret models and quantify the extent to which each feature of the data influences the model's prediction.** This capability helps data scientists and developers identify and mitigate bias in the model.

2. **Privacy and security**:  AI systems should be secure and respect privacy. **The machine learning models on which AI systems are based rely on large volumes of data**, which may contain personal details that must be kept private.

3. **Transparency**: AI systems should be understandable. Users should be made fully aware of the purpose of the system, how it works, and what limitations may be expected.

---

Q. What is **Azure AI Language**?

**Azure AI Language** is a cloud-based service that includes features for understanding and analysing text. 

Azure AI Language includes various features that support sentiment analysis, key phrase identification, text summarisation, and conversational language understanding.
