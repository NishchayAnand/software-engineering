The volatility of electricity prices in wholesale power markets such as PJM’s day-ahead market poses significant challenges for traders, utilities, regulators, and large consumers. Unexpected price spikes or crashes — often driven by sudden demand fluctuations, weather events, fuel price volatility, or regulatory interventions — can result in substantial financial risk and operational inefficiencies.

Traditional analytics typically rely on fixed thresholds or manual monitoring to detect abnormal price movements, which fails to adapt dynamically to changing market conditions. Moreover, while statistical methods can flag anomalies, they do not explain why these anomalies occurred, leaving decision-makers without actionable insights.
  

The problem is twofold:

1. Accurate Detection: Identify outliers (both unusually high and unusually low prices) in PJM day-ahead prices using robust statistical methods (e.g., Modified Z-Score, IQR).

2. Contextual Explanation: Translate these detected outliers into meaningful business insights by connecting them with real-world drivers such as market news, weather reports, fuel disruptions, or regulatory announcements.

The lack of automated, explainable anomaly detection tools limits stakeholders’ ability to proactively manage risks, optimize bidding strategies, and improve decision-making in energy trading and operations.

Therefore, the challenge is to build an intelligent system that not only detects outliers in PJM day-ahead price data but also leverages Generative AI to contextualize these anomalies with natural-language explanations informed by relevant news and market signals.
