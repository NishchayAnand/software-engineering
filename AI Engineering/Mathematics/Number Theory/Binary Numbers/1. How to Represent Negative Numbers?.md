Computers work with **binary numbers (0s and 1s)**. <span style="color:green;">While binary naturally represents <strong>positive integers</strong>, real-world problems often require <strong>negative values</strong> too.</span> So, we need a way to **represent negative numbers in binary** for practical computation.

There are **three main ways** computers can represent **negative numbers in binary**, and each has its own logic and use cases. Here's a breakdown:

---
### Sign-Magnitude Representation

Assign the <span style="color:red;background:#FAEBD7;font-weight:bold">most significant bit (MSB)</span> to indicate whether the value is positive or negative, and the rest of the bits represent the value.

**Example**

```
binary  decimal
  0000        0
  0010        2
  1010       -2
  1101       -5
  1000       -0 (wut?)
```

This system is nice because it is fairly intuitive, but there are two key issues with it. 

The first is that we have two representations of 0 (a “positive” 0 and a “negative” 0). Not only is this a bit confusing, but it also wastes a representation and will make checking for 0 in hardware much more complicated. 

The second issue is that our addition process we used for positive numbers no longer works with negative numbers. 

**Example**

```
carry:  0 0 1 0 0
_________________
          0 0 1 0     (2)
      +   1 0 1 0     (-2)
      ___________
          1 1 0 0     (-4) <- we really want this to be 0!
```

This means that we would have to implement two versions of addition - one for positive numbers and one for negative numbers, which introduces a ton of headaches for us as hardware designers!

### One's Complement Representation

### Two's Complement Representation

Two's complement works by interpreting binary numbers in the same way that you would for positive numbers, but giving the most significant digit a negative weight.

**Example**

```
binary  decimal(unsigned)   decimal(two's complement)
  0000                 0                            0
  0001                 1                            1
  0010                 2                            2
  0011                 3                            3
  0100                 4                            4
  0101                 5                            5
  0110                 6                            6
  0111                 7                            7
  1000                 8                           -8
  1001                 9                           -7
  1010                10                           -6
  1011                11                           -5
  1100                12                           -4
  1101                13                           -3
  1110                14                           -2
  1111                15                           -1
```

Now we only have 1 representation for 0 (who knew this would be something we'd have to worry about?) and it turns out that now we can use the same addition process for both unsigned and signed values!

```
carry:  1 1 1 0 0
_________________
          0 0 1 0     (2)
      +   1 1 1 0     (-2)
      ___________
          0 0 0 0     (0) <- ahhhh much better
        ^ remember we ignore this carry bit
```
