# Understanding Content Delivery network (CDN)

CDN is a network of geographically dispersed servers used to deliver static content. CDN servers cache static content like images, videos, CSS, JavaScript files, etc.

## How CDN works?

When a user visits a website, a CDN server closest to the user will deliver static content.

> **NOTE:** The further users are from CDN servers, the slower the website loads.

## When to use CDN?

- CDNs are run by third-party providers, and you are charged for data tranfers in and out of the CDN. Caching infrequently used assets provides no significant benefits so you should consider moving them out of the CDN.

Static assets must remain accessible even during backend outages via cached CDN delivery.
