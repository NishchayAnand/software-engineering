Design a **Hotel Reservation System** like **MakeMyTrip** that allows users to seamlessly search, book, and manage hotel reservations while supporting real-time availability, secure payments, and smooth communication between customers and hotels.

### Functional Requirements

The following are the core functional requirements of the system:

1. **User Management**: Allow users to register, log in, and manage their personal profiles and preferences.

2. **Hotel Search**: Enable users to search for hotels based on preferences such as location, travel dates, number of guests, and filters like price or amenities.

3. **Hotel Details Display**: Present hotel information including descriptions, photos, amenities, room types, occupancy limits, policies, and real-time pricing.

4. **Booking Management**: Support the complete booking flow, including reservations, confirmations, modifications, and cancellations.

5. **Payment Processing**: Provide secure payment handling with multiple methods, such as credit/debit cards, UPI, wallets, and net banking.

6. **Notifications**: Send booking confirmations, reminders, and updates through email, SMS, and push notifications.

7. **Inventory Management**: Enable hotels or administrators to manage room inventory, rates, and availability effectively.

> **NOTE:** Functional requirements define what the system should do, i.e., the specific features, capabilities, and interactions it must provide to meet user and business needs.Â 

----
### Non-Functional Requirements

The following are the core non-functional requirements of the system:

1. The system must <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">support high volumes of concurrent users, searches, and bookings</span>, with the ability to scale horizontally during peak travel seasons.

2. Search results should be delivered with low latency (e.g., <500 ms for p95), however, it's acceptable for the system to take a few seconds to process a reservation request.

3. Backup and failover mechanisms must exist to recover data and operations quickly in case of outages or regional failures.

> **NOTE:** Non-Functional requirements define how the system should behave under different conditions rather than what features it should provide.

- 5000 hotels -> 1 million rooms 
- customers pay online 
- support cancellation
- allow 10% overbooking ???
- show hotel details page 
- show hotel room-related detail page
- Reserve a room
- admin panel to add / remove / update hotel or room info
- hotel prices can change dynamically. **The price of a hotel room depends on hoe full the hotel is expected to be on a given day.** For now, we can assume the price could be different each day.
- Support high concurrency. During peak season or some big events, some popular hotels may have a lot of customers trying to book the same room.
- Moderate latency. It's okay for the system to take few seconds for processing a reservation request.

internal API like admin APIs can use RPC such as gRPC.
