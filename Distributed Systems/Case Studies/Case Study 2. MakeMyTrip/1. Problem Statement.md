### Functional Requirements

The following are the core functional requirements of the system:

1. Enable users to search for hotels based on preferences such as location, travel dates, number of guests, and filters like price or amenities.

2. Support the complete booking flow, including reservations, confirmations, and cancellations.

3. Provide secure payment handling with multiple methods, such as credit/debit cards, UPI, wallets, and net banking.

4. Enable hotels or administrators to manage room inventory, rates, and availability effectively.

> **NOTE:** Functional requirements define what the system should do, i.e., the specific features, capabilities, and interactions it must provide to meet user and business needs.Â 

----
### Non-Functional Requirements

The following are the core non-functional requirements of the system:

1. The system must <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">support high volumes of concurrent users, searches, and bookings</span>, with the ability to scale horizontally during peak travel seasons.

2. Search results should be delivered with low latency (e.g., <500 ms for p95), however, it's acceptable for the system to take a few seconds to process a reservation request.

3. Backup and failover mechanisms must exist to recover data and operations quickly in case of outages or regional failures.

> **NOTE:** Non-Functional requirements define how the system should behave under different conditions rather than what features it should provide.
