Back-of-the-envelope estimation helps us estimate factors like **traffic load volume**, **data storage capacity**, **bandwidth**, and **throughput**, and guides critical design decisions such as database selection, caching strategies, and service decomposition, ensuring that the system can handle expected loads efficiently without premature optimization.

Letâ€™s perform these estimations for the **Hotel Reservation System** by considering realistic assumptions about **daily active users**, **read / write ratios**, and **storage requirements**.
