Use query parameters in the `GET /hotels` request because it aligns with REST best practices for read-only, idempotent operations like searching. Query parameters make the request easily cacheable, shareable, and bookmarkable, which improves performance and user experience. They are the standard way to send filters and sorting options in a `GET` request, unlike request bodies which are often ignored for GET and break caching. This approach works best for lightweight search criteria; however, if the payload becomes large or sensitive, using a `POST /search` endpoint with a request body is more appropriate.

```
GET /hotels?location=New+York&checkIn=2025-09-15&checkOut=2025-09-20&guests=2&rooms=1&priceMin=100&priceMax=500&sort=price_asc&amenities=wifi,pool
```
