The **Hotel Reservation System** connects **customers** with **hotels**, handling every stage of the reservation process, including **searching, choosing a hotel, booking rooms, processing payments, and delivering notifications**.

Let’s understand the **step-by-step sequence flow of the core use cases** to gain deeper insights into how the system works in practice.

### Use Case 1: Search Hotels

Enable users to search hotels by **location**, **dates**, and **number of guests**, with **filters (e.g., price, amenities, rating)** and **sorting options (e.g., price low-to-high, best rated)**. 

The following interactions describe the step-by-step flow between the **user interface** and the **backend components** during this operation:

<span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold;">Interaction 1: Submit "Search Hotels" Form</span>

1. The `User` enters search criteria such as `destination`, `check-in / check-out dates`, and `number of guests` on the home page and submit the form.
2. The `Frontend` sends a `GET \hotels` request to the `Backend Search Service`, including the search parameters (`destination`, `check-in date`, `check-out date`, `guests`).
3. The `Search Service` acts as an orchestrator

- The **Search Service** sends requests to:
    
    - **Hotel Inventory Service** → Retrieve available hotels and rooms based on location and dates.
        
    - **Pricing Service** → Fetch real-time pricing for each room type.
        
    - **Hotel Details Service** → Get hotel metadata (description, amenities, images, ratings).
        
- Each service responds with relevant data, which is aggregated by the **Search Service**.
The **Search Service** applies user-selected filters (price range, amenities, ratings) and sorting preferences (price low-to-high, best rated).

- The **Search Service** compiles the final list of hotels with details, pricing, and availability.
    
- It returns an **HTTP 200 OK** response to the **Frontend**, including:
    
    - Hotel name, description, location.
        
    - Available room types and pricing.
        
    - Images, amenities, and ratings.
        
- The **Frontend** displays the results in a user-friendly format (list/grid view with filter options).
