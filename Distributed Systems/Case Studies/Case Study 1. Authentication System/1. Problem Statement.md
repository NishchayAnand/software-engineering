**How to implement authorization in a microservice architecture when the necessary data is scattered across multiple services?**

---

The **Authentication Service** acts as the **source of truth for identity** and exposes a set of **stable, well-defined auth / identity APIs** to the rest of the platform. These APIs cover **login** (verifying credentials and issuing tokens), **signup** (creating user accounts and storing credentials securely), **token refresh** (rotating refresh tokens and re-issuing JWTs), and **profile CRUD** (managing user attributes such as name, email, phone, preferences, and roles).

When a user logs in, the **User Service** issues two tokens:

1. **Access Token (JWT)** → short-lived (e.g., 5–15 minutes). Used in API requests.
2. **Refresh Token** → long-lived (e.g., days/weeks). Used only to get a new access token.

Because access tokens expire quickly (for security), the client must **“refresh”** them by calling the User Service with its refresh token. The service verifies the refresh token, issues a **new JWT**, and (optionally) rotates the refresh token.
