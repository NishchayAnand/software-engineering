### Load Estimation

Understanding **how much traffic the system will handle** is crucial for designing a scalable and resilient architecture. It allows us to size infrastructure appropriately, anticipate bottlenecks, and decide where optimizations like **caching** or **load balancing** are required.

To quantify this, let’s estimate the <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">Requests Per Second (RPS)</span> the system must support under both normal and peak load conditions for core user interactions:

```
- Assumption: Daily Active Users (DAU) = 5 Million
- Assumption: 20% of DAU log in per day

- Total Requests per Day = 5M * 20% = 1M
- Average RPS = 1,000,000 / (24 * 60 * 60) ≈ 10 RPS

- Assumption: Peak Load Factor = 5x
- Peak RPS = 10 * 5 ≈ 50 RPS

- Assumption: Average Search Requests per User per Day = 5

- Total Requests per Day = 5M * 5 = 25M
- Average RPS = 25,000,000 / (86,400) ≈ 250 RPS

- Assumption: Peak Load Factor = 5x
- Peak RPS = 250 * 5 ≈ 1,250 RPS
