Caching is layered to attack the biggest byte and query hotspots first. At the application tier we cache the first pages of popular searches and hotel details in Redis with short TTLs (minutes) and versioned keys so writes can invalidate only affected entries. 

Availability is cached aggressively with very short TTLs (seconds) and write-through invalidation on successful bookings; even modest hit rates here shave milliseconds off end-to-end latency and protect the primary store. On the client and edge we leverage HTTP caching semantics—immutable, fingerprinted JS/CSS and pre-generated thumbnails—so repeat visits incur minimal transfer.
