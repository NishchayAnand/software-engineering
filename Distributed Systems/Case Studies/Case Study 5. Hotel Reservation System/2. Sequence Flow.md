The **Hotel Reservation System** connects **customers** with **hotels**, handling every stage of the reservation process, including **searching, choosing a hotel, booking rooms, processing payments, and delivering notifications**.

Let’s understand the **step-by-step sequence flow of the core use cases** to gain deeper insights into how the system works in practice.

### Use Case 1: Search Hotels

Enable customers to search hotels by **location**, **dates**, and **number of guests**, with **filters (e.g., price, amenities, rating)** and **sorting options (e.g., price low-to-high, best rated)**. 

The following interactions describe the step-by-step flow between the **user interface** and the **backend components** during this operation:

1. The `Customer` enters the search criteria such as `destination`, `check_in_date`,  `check_out_date`, and the `number_of_guests` on the home page and submits the form.

2. The `Frontend` sends a `GET \hotels` request to the `SearchService`, including the search parameters: `destination`, `check_in_date`, `check_out_date`, `number_of_guests`.

3. The `SearchService` first queries the `HotelService` to identify hotels that meet the basic criteria, such as `destination`. This step quickly narrows down the list of potential options based on relatively static information that does not change often. 

4. Once a list of candidate hotels is identified, the`SearchService` calls the `InventoryService` to verify whether those hotels actually have rooms available for the specified dates and fetch the most up-to-date pricing. Since room inventory and prices fluctuate frequently, this step ensures accuracy and prevents displaying stale or incorrect information. 

5. Finally, the `SearchService` aggregates the static hotel details with the dynamic availability data and returns a refined list of bookable hotels to the `Customer`.
