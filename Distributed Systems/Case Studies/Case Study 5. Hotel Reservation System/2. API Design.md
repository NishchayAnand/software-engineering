### Load Estimation

Understanding **how much traffic the system will handle** is crucial for designing a scalable and resilient architecture. It allows us to size infrastructure appropriately, anticipate bottlenecks, and decide where optimizations like **caching** or **load balancing** are required.

To quantify this, let’s estimate the <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold;background:beige;">Requests Per Second (RPS)</span> the system must support under both normal and peak load conditions for core user interactions:

<span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold">Login User</span>

```
- Assumption: Daily Active Users (DAU) = 5 Million
- Assumption: 20% of DAU log in per day

- Total Requests per Day = 5M * 20% = 1M
- Average RPS = 1,000,000 / (24 * 60 * 60) ≈ 10 RPS

- Assumption: Peak Load Factor = 5x
- Peak RPS = 10 * 5 ≈ 50 RPS
```

<span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold">Search Hotels</span>

```
- Assumption: Average Search Requests per User per Day = 5

- Total Requests per Day = 5M * 5 = 25M
- Average RPS = 25,000,000 / (86,400) ≈ 250 RPS

- Assumption: Peak Load Factor = 5x
- Peak RPS = 250 * 5 ≈ 1,250 RPS
```

<span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold">View Details of Selected Hotel</span>

```
- Assumption: 50% of users view details after search
- Assumption: Average View Details Requests per User per Day = 2

- Total Requests per Day = 5M * 50% * 2 = 5,000,000
- Average RPS = 5,000,000 / (86,400) ≈ 50 RPS

- Assumption: Peak Load Factor = 5x
- Peak RPS = 50 * 5 ≈ 250 RPS
```

<span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold">Book a Hotel Room</span>

```
- Assumption: 2% of users make a booking per day
- Assumption: Average Booking Requests per User per Day = 1

- Total Requests per Day = 5M * 2% = 100,000
- Average RPS = 100,000 / (24 * 60 * 60) ≈ 1 RPS

- Assumption: Peak Load Factor = 5x
- Peak RPS = 1 * 5 = 5 RPS
```

<span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">Summary</span>

| Operation          | Total Requests / Day | Avg RPS | Peak RPS (5x) |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ------- | ------------- |
| Login User         | 1,000,000            | 10      | 50            |
| Search Hotels      | 25,000,000           | 250     | 1,250         |
| View Hotel Details | 5,000,000            | 50      | 250           |
| Book Hotel Room    | 100,000              | 1       | 5             |

Use query parameters in the `GET /hotels` request because it aligns with REST best practices for read-only, idempotent operations like searching. Query parameters make the request easily cacheable, shareable, and bookmarkable, which improves performance and user experience. They are the standard way to send filters and sorting options in a `GET` request, unlike request bodies which are often ignored for GET and break caching. This approach works best for lightweight search criteria; however, if the payload becomes large or sensitive, using a `POST /search` endpoint with a request body is more appropriate.

```
GET /hotels?location=New+York&checkIn=2025-09-15&checkOut=2025-09-20&guests=2&rooms=1&priceMin=100&priceMax=500&sort=price_asc&amenities=wifi,pool
```
