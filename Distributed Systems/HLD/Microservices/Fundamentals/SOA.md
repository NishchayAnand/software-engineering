# Understanding Service-Oriented Architecture

A service typically means a completely separate operating system process. Communication between these services occurs via calls across a network rather than method calls within a process boundary.

SOA emerged as an approach to combat the challenges of the large monolithic applications.

> **NOTE:** We can replace one service with another without anyone knowing, as long as the semantics of the services don't change too much.

Microservices is a specific approach to achieve SOA.
