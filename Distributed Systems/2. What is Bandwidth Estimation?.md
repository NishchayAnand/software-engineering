When we do **bandwidth estimation**, our purpose is to measure how much **data per second** flows into and out of the system. This number matters for three reasons:

1. **Size network throughput** – We need to know if our servers, load balancers, and cloud network capacity can handle the amount of traffic at peak times. (e.g., can the infra handle 700 Mbps of outbound hotel images?)

2. **Justify caching** – If a lot of bandwidth is being spent repeatedly on the same requests (like hotel search results), we can save both **database load** and **network usage** by putting results in a cache (Redis / Memcached).

3. **Decide where a CDN is essential** – Static assets like **hotel images** are very bandwidth-heavy. Estimation shows that serving them directly from the database or app servers would overwhelm the system. A **CDN (Content Delivery Network)** offloads this traffic by serving images closer to the user, reducing load on the origin.

**Bandwidth estimation** measures how much data flows into and out of the system each second. It plays a key role in sizing network throughput requirements and identifying optimization opportunities. 

By understanding bandwidth usage, we can determine when **caching** is needed to reduce redundant data transfers and where a **CDN** is essential to offload heavy traffic, such as images and other static assets, ensuring both performance and cost efficiency.

> **NOTE:** Network throughput is usually measured in **Mbps (megabits per second)** or **Gbps (gigabits per second)**.

bandwidth estimation **directly impacts how services should communicate with each other**, especially in a distributed system

Here’s how bandwidth estimation helps in choosing the communication strategy:

---

### 1. **Communication Style: Synchronous vs Asynchronous**

- **High Bandwidth, Low Latency Network** → You can afford more **synchronous RPC calls** (e.g., REST, gRPC) because the cost of waiting on responses is low.
    
- **Limited Bandwidth or Higher Latency Links** → Better to use **asynchronous communication** (e.g., message queues, Kafka, event streaming) so services don’t block each other while waiting for responses.
    

---

### 2. **Data Format & Serialization**

- **Bandwidth-Constrained Links** → Prefer **compact formats** (e.g., Protobuf, Avro, Thrift) over verbose ones like JSON/XML.
    
- **Ample Bandwidth** → Readable formats (like JSON) may be fine since developer experience and debugging might weigh more than raw efficiency.

### 3. **Frequency & Size of Data Transfer**

- If estimation shows **large payloads** (like hotel images, user documents), then use:
    
    - **CDNs, object storage, or direct client fetches** instead of service-to-service calls.
        
    - Services only exchange **metadata** over the network.
        
- For **small, frequent updates** (e.g., availability counts, pricing updates):
    
    - Use **event-driven messaging** with **incremental updates** instead of pushing full datasets.
        

---

### 4. **Connection Strategy**

- **High Bandwidth + Reliable Network** → Services can maintain **persistent connections** (gRPC, WebSockets).
    
- **Low Bandwidth / Unstable Network** → Use **stateless HTTP calls** or **retry mechanisms with queues** to avoid bottlenecks.
    

---

### 5. **System Design Trade-offs**

- In **data centers with 10–100 Gbps bandwidth**, synchronous RPC-heavy architectures (like gRPC microservices) work fine.
    
- In **geo-distributed systems** (e.g., booking service in US, hotel service in India), bandwidth estimation helps decide:
    
    - What **data to replicate locally** to reduce cross-region chatter.
        
    - What **communication pattern** (event sourcing, CQRS, eventual consistency) to adopt.

✅ **Summary:**  
Yes — bandwidth estimation tells you whether services can afford synchronous RPC calls with verbose payloads, or if you should prefer asynchronous/event-driven communication with compressed or minimal data transfer. Essentially, it guides the balance between **performance, cost, and reliability** in service-to-service communication.
