When we do **bandwidth estimation**, our purpose is to measure how much **data per second** flows into and out of the system. This number matters for three reasons:

1. **Size network throughput** – We need to know if our servers, load balancers, and cloud network capacity can handle the amount of traffic at peak times. (e.g., can the infra handle 700 Mbps of outbound hotel images?)

2. **Justify caching** – If a lot of bandwidth is being spent repeatedly on the same requests (like hotel search results), we can save both **database load** and **network usage** by putting results in a cache (Redis / Memcached).

3. **Decide where a CDN is essential** – Static assets like **hotel images** are very bandwidth-heavy. Estimation shows that serving them directly from the database or app servers would overwhelm the system. A **CDN (Content Delivery Network)** offloads this traffic by serving images closer to the user, reducing load on the origin.

**Bandwidth estimation** measures how much data flows into and out of the system each second. It plays a key role in sizing network throughput requirements and identifying optimization opportunities. 

By understanding bandwidth usage, we can determine when **caching** is needed to reduce redundant data transfers and where a **CDN** is essential to offload heavy traffic, such as images and other static assets, ensuring both performance and cost efficiency.

> **NOTE:** Network throughput is usually measured in **Mbps (megabits per second)** or **Gbps (gigabits per second)**.
