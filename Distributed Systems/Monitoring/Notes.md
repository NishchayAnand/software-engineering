# Understanding How to Monitor Large Systems

When working with a small website that runs on a few servers, **logging**, **metrics**, and **automation** support are good practices but not a necessity. However, as your website grows to serve large business, investing in those tools is essential.

## Logging

Monitoring error logs is important because it helps to identify errors and problems in the system. You can monitor error logs at per server level or use tools to aggregate them to a centralized service for easy search and viewing.

## Metrics

Monitoring the health status of the system allows us to get business insights such as how we can reduce the load on the system, how we can save cost, etc. Different metrics can be used to gain different types of insights. For example, `CPU Consumption`, `Memory Consumption`, `Daily Active Users`, `Retention`, etc.

## Automation

When a system gets big and complex, we need to build or leverage automation tools to improve productivity. For example, continuous integration is a good practice, in which each code check-in is verified through automation, allowing teams to detect problems early.
