A **daemon** is a background process in Linux that:

- runs continuously
- provides services to the system
- doesn’t need a user logged in

Examples of daemons:

| Daemon    | What It Does                       |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `sshd`    | Handles SSH login connections      |
| `nginx`   | Runs your web server               |
| `mysqld`  | Runs the MySQL database            |
| `systemd` | Manages all services on the system |

Think of a daemon as a **background helper program** that keeps working silently.

### What is `systemd`?

`systemd` is a **daemon** that manages all other daemons.

It is the "brain" of Linux service management.

Systemd is responsible for:

- starting services
- stopping services
- restarting services
- enabling autostart on boot
- monitoring and keeping services alive
- reading service files

It reads your `.service` files from:

```
/etc/systemd/system/
```

### Why does `systemd` need to be reloaded?

When you:

- **create a new service file**
- **modify a service file**
- **delete a service file**

`systemd` **does NOT** automatically detect the change. Because `systemd` **keeps a cached copy** of all service definitions in memory. So if you edit a service file but **don’t reload**, `systemd` will still use the old version.
