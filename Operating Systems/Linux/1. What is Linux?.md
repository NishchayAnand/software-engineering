In Linux, the filesystem is organized like an **inverted tree**, starting from a single top-level directory called **root (`/`)**.  
Every file, folder, device, and configuration lives somewhere under `/`.

Here is a clear, beginner-friendly explanation of all important directories:

# **op-Level Directories Explained**

### **`/` — Root directory**

- The top of the entire filesystem.
    
- Contains all other directories.
    
- Only one `/` exists in a Linux system.
    

---

# 🖥 1. **`/bin` — Essential user binaries**

Contains basic commands used by _all_ users, needed even in emergency mode.

Examples:

```
ls, cp, mv, rm, cat, echo, pwd
```

# 🧰 2. **`/sbin` — System binaries**

Executables used by system administrators (root).

Examples:

`iptables, reboot, fdisk, mount`

---

# 📁 3. **`/home` — Home directories for users**

Each user gets a folder here.

Example:

`/home/ec2-user /home/nish`

Your files, downloads, code, environment settings all go here.

---

# 👑 4. **`/root` — Root user’s home directory**

Home directory for the superuser, similar to `/home/ec2-user` but with admin privileges.

---

# ⚙️ 5. **`/etc` — Configuration files**

Stores system-wide configuration for services and applications.

Examples:

`/etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/systemd/system/myapp.service /etc/nginx/nginx.conf`

This is where your **service files** go.

---

# 📦 6. **`/usr` — User-installed software & libraries**

Contains **read-only** user tools, libraries, and utilities.

Subdirectories:

- `/usr/bin` → common user binaries
    
- `/usr/sbin` → system binaries
    
- `/usr/lib` → libraries
    
- `/usr/local` → manually installed programs
    

---

# 🔌 7. **`/var` — Variable data**

Stores files that keep changing.

Examples:

`/var/log/         → logs /var/lib/mysql/   → database files /var/www/         → website content /var/cache/       → cached data`

---

# 💽 8. **`/opt` — Optional software**

Used for manually installed software packages (e.g., third-party apps).

Example:

`/opt/tomcat /opt/jetbrains`

---

# 🧩 9. **`/lib` and `/lib64` — Shared libraries**

Holds essential libraries required by binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin`.

---

# 📂 10. **`/media` — Removable media mount point**

USB drives, SD cards are mounted here automatically.

---

# 🔐 11. **`/mnt` — Temporary mount point**

Used for manually mounting filesystems.

Example:

`sudo mount /dev/xvdf /mnt/data`

---

# 💾 12. **`/dev` — Device files**

Everything is treated as a file in Linux, including devices.

Examples:

`/dev/sda    → Hard disk /dev/null   → Bit bucket /dev/tty    → Terminal`

---

# 🧵 13. **`/proc` — Virtual system information**

A virtual filesystem that provides system and process info.

Examples:

`/proc/cpuinfo /proc/meminfo /proc/1234 (process details)`

---

# 🌐 14. **`/run` — Runtime information**

PID files, lock files, runtime sockets.

---

# ☁️ 15. **`/tmp` — Temporary files**

	Anyone can write here; files may be auto-deleted.

# Linux Modes (Targets) — Simple Explanation

Linux has several boot modes. The most important ones:

### **1️⃣ `rescue.target` — Repair mode**

- Minimal system
    
- Only root user
    
- No networking
    
- Used for fixing broken systems
    

### **2️⃣ `multi-user.target` — Server mode (Common for EC2)**

✔ Networking enabled  
✔ Multiple users can log in  
✔ All services (database, apps, web servers) run  
❌ No graphical desktop

This is what servers normally use.

### **3️⃣ `graphical.target` — Desktop mode**

Same as multi-user mode **+ graphical user interface (GUI)**.

Used on laptops/desktops, not servers.
