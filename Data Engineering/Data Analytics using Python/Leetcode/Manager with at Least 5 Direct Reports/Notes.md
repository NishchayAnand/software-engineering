# Managers with at Least 5 Direct Reports

Given an **Employee** dataframe where each row indicates the **id** of the employee, **name** of an employee, their **department**, and the **id of their manager**. Write a solution to find managers with at least five direct reports (return the result table in any order).

```
| id | name | department | managerId |
|----|------|------------|-----------|
|101 |John  |A           |NaN        |
|102 |Dan   |A           |101        |
|103 |James |A           |101        |
|104 |Amy   |A           |101        |
|105 |Anne  |A           |101        |
|106 |Ron   |B           |101        |
```

**NOTE:** 
- If `managerId` is null, then the employee does not have a manager.
- No employee will be the manager of themselves.

## General Observations

- Task is to return the names of managers (employees) whose count of reportees (employees) is greater than or equal to 5.

## Algorithm

1. Use the **groupby()** method to group rows by `managerId` and count the number of employees reporting to each manager. 

    ```
    direct_reports_count = employee.groupby('managerId').size().reset_index(name='direct_reports')

    | managerId | direct_reports |
    |-----------|----------------|
    |101        |5               |
    ```

2. Filter managerIds where the direct report's count is greater than or equal to 5.

    ```
    direct_reports_count = direct_reports_count[direct_reports_count['direct_reports'] >= 5]

    | managerId | direct_reports |
    |-----------|----------------|
    |101        |5               |
    ```

3. Use the **merge()** function to perform an inner join between `direct_reports_count` and `employee` dataframe to link manager's `id` with manager's `name`.

    ```
    direct_reports_count.rename(columns={'managerId': 'id'}, inplace=True)
    merged = pd.merge(direct_reports_count, employee, on='id')

    | id | reportee_count | name | department | managerId |
    |----|----------------|------|------------|-----------|
    |101 |5               |John  |A           |NaN        | 
    ```
