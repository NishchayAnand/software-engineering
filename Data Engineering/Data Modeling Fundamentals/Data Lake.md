Data lakes, similar to data warehouses, are built as a central store of data for the entire organisation for analysis. Therefore, they store data for many different departments, have many input data sources, and are large. **However, data lakes can hold non-structured data, such as videos or audio files.** 

A **Data Scientist** might use this unstructured data in a model that analyses video of a production process for quality control.

<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">Q. What is the difference between a data warehouse and a data lake?</span>

Compared to data warehouses, it is easier to make changes to data lakes because of their flexibility in storing unstructured data. This flexibility also allows storing data whose purpose may not be known today but may be helpful for future analysis. In contrast, when designing table structures for data warehouses and marts, organizations tend to know how they want to use the data for analysis.
