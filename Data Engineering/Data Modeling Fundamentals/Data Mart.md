A data mart is a relational database that stores an organisation's transactional data for analysis. 

Data marts and data warehouses both hold structured data. However, whereas a data warehouse contains data from many different departments, a data mart only focuses on one department, such as just Finance. 

Data marts have only a few input data sources versus a data warehouse with many. Often the input source is a subset of data from a data warehouse. 

Additionally, a data mart is typically less than 100 GB, which is smaller than most data warehouses.
