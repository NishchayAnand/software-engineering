# Understanding Relational Data Model

- `Atomicity`: **A transaction is treated as a single unit.** Either all operations within a transaction are completed sucessfully or none of them are.

- `Consistency`: **A transaction moves the database from one consistent state to another.**

- `Isolation`: **Changes made by one transaction are not visible to other transactions until it is committed.**

- `Durability`: **Once a transaction is commit, its changes are permanent.**
