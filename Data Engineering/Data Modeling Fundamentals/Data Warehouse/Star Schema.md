# Understanding Star Schema Design

A star schema is a data modeling technique used in data warehousing to represent data in a structured and intuitive way. It's named after its visual representation, **resembling a star with a `central fact table` and `surrounding dimension tables`**.

## Fact Table

- Contains quantitative data or measures (e.g., sales amount, units sold, profit).
- Each row represents a specific event or transaction.
- Contains foreign keys referencing dimension tables.

## Dimension Table

- Provide context or attributes for the data in the fact table (e.g., customer, product, time, location).
- Contain descriptive information about the dimensions.
- Have a primary key that is referenced by the fact table.

## How Does it Work?

- **Data Organization**: Fact table stores the core measurements. Dimension tables provide detailed information about the dimensions.
- **Relationships**: The fact table is connected to multiple dimension tables through foreign key relationships.
- **Querying**: Users can easily query the data by joining the fact table with relevant dimension tables. This allows for analysis and reporting on different dimensions.
