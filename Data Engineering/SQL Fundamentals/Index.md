# Understanding Index

A database index is a data structure that speeds up data retrieval operations on a database table. Essentially, it's a shortcut that helps the database find specific information quickly without having to scan the entire table.

A index is a pointer to data in a table.

## How to implement Indexes?

An index is typically a B-tree, a data structure designed for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion. It contains a copy of selected columns from a table, organized in a specific order (usually sorted). The index points to the actual data in the table, allowing the database to locate records efficiently.

For example, consider a table of `students` with columns: `student_id`, `name`, `age`, and `city`. An index on `student_id` would create a sorted list of all `student_id` values with pointers to the corresponding rows. To find a student with a specific `student_id`, the database can quickly locate the index entry and follow the pointer to the correct row.
