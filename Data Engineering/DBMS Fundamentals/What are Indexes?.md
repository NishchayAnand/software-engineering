Imagine you are operating a website for selling used cars. Each listing has a unique ID—call it the document ID—and you partition the database by the document ID (for example, IDs 0 to 499 in partition 0, IDs 500 to 999 in partition 1, etc.).

You want to let users search for cars, allowing them to filter by colour and by make, so you need a secondary index on colour and make (in a document database these would be fields; in a relational database they would be columns).

If you have declared the index, the database can perform the indexing automatically.ii For example, whenever a red car is added to the database, the database partition automatically adds it to the list of document IDs for the index entry **color:red**.
