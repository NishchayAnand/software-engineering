1. To keep data geographically close to your users (and thus reduce latency).

2. To allow the system to continue working even if some of its components have failed (and thus increase availability).

3. To scale out the number of machines that can serve read queries (and thus increase read throughput).

> **NOTE:** For better reliability, replicas are placed in distinct data centres, and data centres are connected through high-speed networks.
