# Understanding Non-Relational (NoSQL) Database Management Systems

Non-relational databases are faster than the equivalent relational database. Relational database management systems have a lot of overhead to provide features we enjoy about them (for e.g., **ACID Transactions, Forcing Schema, Checking Referencial Integrity between Tables, Allowing Multiple Table Joins**).

**Types:**

1. **MongoDB**: Document Database
2. **Redis**: Key-Value Store
3. **Cassandra**: Wide-Column Store
4. **Neo4J**: Graph Database
