# Understanding SMTP

- Stands for `Simple Mail Transfer Protocol`.
- An internet standard communication protocol specifically designed for transmitting **electronic mail (email)** over computer networks. It defines how email clients and servers communicate to send and receive messages.
- It focuses on sending emails, not retrieving them.
- Modern email systems often use secure versions of SMTP like `SMTPS (port 465)` that encrypt communication to protect sensitive information.

## SMTP Servers

Most email providers (e.g. `Gmail`, `Yahoo`, `Outlook`) have dedicated SMTP servers for their users. A quick web search for "your email provider + SMTP settings" **(e.g., "Gmail SMTP settings")** can often lead you to the relevant information.
