`doctest`:

Great for smaller examples, but you often can't cover every case you want to test in a `docstring`. For example, if your function returns a large pandas DataFrame this could be hard to include as a `doctest`.

`pytest`:

To use `pytest`, I recommend a tests directory at the same level as your package's directory.
