Q. Difference between args and kwargs.

`*args` and `**kwargs` are used in Python functions to allow them to accept an arbitrary number of arguments.

- `*args`: Allows a function to accept any number of positional arguments. The argument are stored as a `tuple`.

- `**kwargs`: Allows a function to accept any number of keyword arguments. The argument are stored as a `dictionary`.

**Q. What is `isinstance` function?**

The isinstance() function is used to check whether an object is an instance of a class or one of its subclasses.

**Syntax:** `isinstance(object, classinfo)`

Where:

- **object:** object you want to check the type of
- **classinfo:** specified the type (class) or types (tuple of classes) you want to compare the object with.

**Q. How to write a DataFrame to an Excel file and open it immediately without saving it permanently to disk?**

Unfortunately, pandas' `to_excel` function itself doesn't have a built-in option to directly open the Excel file without saving it to disk. However, you can achieve this using **an in-memory buffer** and **temporary file handling**.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Use `io.BytesIO` functionality to create an in-memory file-like object (a.k.a buffer) that can be used to store and manipulate binary data.

2. Write DataFrame content to the buffer object.

3. Open a temporary Excel file in write binary mode and write the buffer content to it.

4. Open the temporary file with the default application associated with Excel files on your system.
