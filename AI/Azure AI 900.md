# Certification Questions

Q. What is **Machine Learning**?

**Machine Learning** is the way we "teach" a computer model to make predictions and draw conclusions from data.

> NOTE: Machine learning is the foundation behind an AI system.

---

Q. What is **Computer Vision**?

**Computer Vision** is the capabilities within AI to interpret the world visually through cameras, video, and images.

> NOTE: Most computer vision solutions are based on machine learning models that can be applied to visual input from cameras, videos, or images.

Q. What is **Natural Language Processing**?

**Natural Language Processing** is the capabilities within AI for a computer to interpret written or spoken language, and respond in kind.

---

Q. What is **Azure AI Speech**?

Can be used to build natural language processing solutions. Azure AI Speech features include speech recognition and synthesis, real-time translations, conversation transcriptions, and more.

---

Q. What is **Azure AI Translator**?

Uses a **Neural Machine Translation (NMT)** model for translation, which analyses the semantic context of the text and renders a more accurate and complete translation as a result.

---

Q. What is **Document Intelligence**?

**Document Intelligence** Capabilities within AI that deal with managing, processing, and using high volumes of data found in forms and documents.

---

Q. What is **Knowledge Mining**?

**Knowledge Mining** is the capabilities within AI to extract information from large volumes of often unstructured data to create a searchable knowledge store.

---

Q. What is **Azure AI Search**?

A private, enterprise, search solution that has tools for building indexes. The indexes can then be used to index previously unsearchable documents and to extract and surface insights from large amounts of data quickly.

---

Q. What is **Generative AI**?

**Generative AI** is the capabilities within AI that create original content in a variety of formats including natural language, image, code, and more.

---

Q. Explain the key principles behind Responsible AI.

1. **Fairness**: AI systems should treat all people fairly. **Azure Machine Learning includes the capability to interpret models and quantify the extent to which each feature of the data influences the model's prediction.** This capability helps data scientists and developers identify and mitigate bias in the model.

2. **Privacy and security**:  AI systems should be secure and respect privacy. **The machine learning models on which AI systems are based rely on large volumes of data**, which may contain personal details that must be kept private.

3. **Transparency**: AI systems should be understandable. Users should be made fully aware of the purpose of the system, how it works, and what limitations may be expected.
