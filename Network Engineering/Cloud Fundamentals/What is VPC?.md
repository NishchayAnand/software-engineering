A **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** is a logically isolated, private section of the cloud (like AWS, GCP, or Azure) where you can launch and manage your cloud resources such as servers, databases, and applications.

Think of it as your **own private data center inside the cloud**, but with all the scalability, flexibility, and reliability benefits of cloud infrastructure.

> **NOTE:** Your VPC is logically separated from other customers' VPCs in the cloud.

### Need For VPC

We need a **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** because when we deploy applications or services in the cloud, we want the **same level of control, security, and isolation** as if we were running them in our own on-premises data center.

> **NOTE:** Without a VPC, your resources would share a flat network with others in the cloud (not safe).
