A **route table** is a set of rules that tells your network **where to send traffic**.

Every **subnet** in a VPC must be associated with a route table. The route table determines how network packets leaving that subnet are forwarded (e.g., to another subnet, to the internet, to a VPN, etc.).

> **NOTE:** Think of it as the **GPS for your data**: it decides the “next hop” for any packet based on the destination IP.
