# Understanding S3

- An object storage service.

- Stores data as objects rather than as files in a file system or blocks in a block storage system. Each object consists of:
    - **Data:** The actual file or binary data.
    - **Metadata:** Associated information about the file (e.g., file size, type).
    - **Unique Identifier (Key):** The name of the object, which allows you to retrieve it later.

## Buckets

S3 stores objects in containers called **buckets.** Buckets help organize and manage your objects. Each bucket has a globally unique name in the AWS S3 namespace.

You can create multiple buckets to segregate data based on project, application, or organizational needs.

## Features

- **Durability:** Designed to provide 99.999999999% (11 nines) durability by automatically storing multiple copies of your data across different devices in multiple Availability Zones.

- **Availability:** Offers high availability to ensure that your data is accessible at all times.

- **Security:** You can control access to your data using `AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)`, bucket policies, and access control lists (ACLs). Data stored in S3 can also be encrypted both at rest and in transit.
