Q. What us gRPC?

In gRPC, you define a service to specify what methods can be called remotely with the corresponding parameters and return types. 

On the server-side, this interface is implemented, and a gRPC server is run to handle client calls, while on the client-side, a client that provides access to the same methods as a server - is run.
