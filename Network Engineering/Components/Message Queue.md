# Understanding Message Queue

We need to decouple different components of the system so they can be scaled independently. Message Queue is a key strategy employed by many real-world distributed systems to solve this problem.

Message Queues support asynchronous communication. The basic architecture of a message queue is simple. Input services, called producers/publishers, create messages, and publish them to a message queue. Other services or servers, called consumers/subscribers, connect to the queue, and perform actions defined by the messages.

With the message queue, the producer can post a message to the queue when the consumer is unavailable to process it. The consumer can read messages from the queue when the producer is unavailable.

Use message brokers (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for asynchronous communication between services. This decouples services by allowing them to communicate without directly depending on each otherâ€™s availability.
