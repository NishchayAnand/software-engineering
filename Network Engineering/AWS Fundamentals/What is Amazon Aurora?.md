Amazon Aurora is a cloud-optimized relational database that gives you:
	•	5x faster than MySQL
	•	3x faster than PostgreSQL
	•	Fully managed (AWS handles backups, failover, replication, patching)
	•	Highly available (up to 15 read replicas)
	•	Auto-scaling storage (starts at 10 GB and grows up to 128 TB)
	•	Built-in distributed storage system designed to survive failures

Aurora separates compute (instances) from storage (distributed across 2 AZs), which reduces latency.

Data is automatically replicated 6 times across availability zones.
