Replication means keeping a copy of the same data on multiple machines that are connected via a network.

To ensure every write is propagated to all replicas, Every write to the database needs to be processed by every replica, otherwise, the replicas would no longer contain the same data.

> **NOTE:** To achieve high availability and reliability, data must be replicated.
