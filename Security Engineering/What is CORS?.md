CORS is a browser mechanism that allows access to resources outside a specific domain. To ensure security, many browsers prohibit cross-origin HTTP requests. 

When the token is sent in the Authorization header, cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is no longer a problem since it doesn't use user credentials, such as cookies, on requests.
