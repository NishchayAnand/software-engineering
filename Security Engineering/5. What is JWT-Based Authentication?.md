Token-based authentication is a process that allows a user to verify their identity through a unique access token. As long as the token remains valid, the user can access the website or app from which they received the token. They donâ€™t need to re-enter their credentials, meaning their username and password, each time they try to access the same website or app.

### What are JWTs?

JSON Web Tokens, more commonly known as JWTs, are encoded and cryptographically signed data that allows for the secure transfer of information.

The JWTs carry a special message authentication code (MAC) that confirms the authenticity of their contained claims.

JWTs are either signed using a special HMAC algorithm or a private and public key pair. This key pair ensures the protection of the claim or information.

### How Can JWTs Be Used?

JWT should be used for API or user authentication and server-to-server or user authorization.

**User Authentication**

User authentication is the process that involves the verification of the user. It ensures that the user is the same person they claim to be.

At this step, the user needs to validate their credentials through providing ID or passwords, answering security questions, or using facial recognition. User authentication is generally performed before user authorization.

**User Authorization**

It is the process that involves the verification of the resources the user can or cannot access. This step comes after user authentication, where the user is granted access to certain resources based on policies and rules.

### Token Expiration

When a user receives an access token, it comes with details about a refresh token and an expiration time. For example:

```
{
  "access_token": "AYjcyMzY3ZDhiNmJkNTY",
  "refresh_token": "RjY2NjM5NzA2OWJjuE7c",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires": 3600
}
```

### How Do JWTs Work?

A JSON Web Token is returned in authentication when the user succeeds in signing in with their credentials. It's recommended that users not keep tokens for an extended period as it can pose severe security issues.

Whenever the user intends to access a protected server, they need to send the JWT, generally in the Authorization header, with the help of the Bearer schema. The Bearer schema or Bearer authentication is an HTTP authentication scheme that includes security tokens called bearer tokens. The name "Bearer authentication" actually refers to "give access to the bearer of this token."

The Authorization Bearer header looks like this:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```
