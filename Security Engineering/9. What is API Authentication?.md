APIs are essential for building powerful applications that can communicate and share data with other systems.

However, with great power comes great responsibility: it's critical to ensure that only authorized users can access your API, and that requests are properly authenticated and verified. Failure to do so can lead to serious security breaches, data leaks, and other vulnerabilities that can compromise the integrity of your application and put your users at risk.

There might be some API routes that you intentionally leave unauthenticated for various reasons. For instance, a login or registration route needs to be unauthenticated so that users can authenticate or create an account. Similarly, you might provide some public data through your API that doesn't require authentication.

Application programming interface (API) authentication is the process of verifying the identity of users trying to get access to the resources on a server. The authentication process includes the use of API tokens.

API tokens are sort of a unique identity of a user or an application trying to access a service. When an application wants to access a service, it generates an API token for the application that it can use when requesting that particular service. Later, when the application makes an access request, the service matches the token provided by the app to the one it had stored to authenticate.

Simply put, an API token works just like a username and password combination. However, the API tokens provide a second layer of security, and the users have substantial control over each action and transaction.
