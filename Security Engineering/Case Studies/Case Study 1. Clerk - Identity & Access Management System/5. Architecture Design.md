The access token contains information about the user including their identity and roles, and plays a central role in the authorization process. When the logged-in user performs actions in the UI, the browser-based UI makes HTTP requests to the BFF (Backend for Frontend) that include the session cookie. The BFF extracts the access token from the session cookie and includes it in the HTTP requests that it makes to backend services.
