A multi-factor authentication method verifies users' identities via multiple authentication methods. For example, when users enter their ID and password, they won't access the resources directly. Instead, they must verify themselves via a one-time link or a security code sent to them through text messages or emails.

The multi-factor authentication strategy ensures multiple layers of protection over the user's account and private data. Even if a hacker determines any users' ID and password, they also have to go through additional authentication methods â€” or else, they will be denied access.
